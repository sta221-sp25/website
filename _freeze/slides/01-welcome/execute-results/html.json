Complete all the preparation work before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions in class, office hours, and on Ed Discussion.\n\n3.  Do the homework and labs; get started on homework early when possible.\n\n4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements on Ed Discussion and sent via email.\n\n# Questions?\n\nRaise your hand or post under the Lectures channel on Ed Discussion.\n\n# Reproducible workflow\n\n## Reproducibility checklist\n\n::: question\nWhat does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Near term goals**:\n\n✔️ Can the tables and figures be exactly reproduced from the code and data?\n\n✔️ Does the code actually do what you think it does?\n\n✔️ In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?\n\n. . .\n\n**Long term goals**:\n\n✔️ Can the code be used for other data?\n\n✔️ Can you extend the code to do other things?\n\n## Why is reproducibility important?\n\n-   Results produced are more reliable and trustworthy [@ostblom2022]\n\n-   Facilitates more effective collaboration [@ostblom2022]\n\n-   Contributing to science, which builds and organizes knowledge in terms of testable hypotheses [@alexander2023]\n\n-   Possible to identify and correct errors or biases in the analysis process [@alexander2023]\n\n## Toolkit\n\n-   **Scriptability** $\\rightarrow$ R\n\n-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\\rightarrow$ Quarto\n\n-   **Version control** $\\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub\n\n## R and RStudio\n\n-   R is a statistical programming language\n\n-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)\n\n![Source: Statistical Inference via Data Science](images/01/r_vs_rstudio_1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## RStudio IDE\n\n![](images/01/rstudio-panes.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Quarto\n\n-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render\n\n-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks\n\n-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)\n\n## Quarto\n\n![](images/01/quarto.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## How will we use Quarto?\n\n-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document\n\n-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with\n\n-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester\n\n# Version control with git and GitHub\n\n## What is versioning?\n\n<br>\n\n![](images/01/lego-steps.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What is versioning?\n\nwith human readable messages\n\n![](images/01/lego-steps-commit-messages.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Why do we need version control?\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/01/phd_comics_vc.gif){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nProvides a clear record of how the analysis methods evolved.
