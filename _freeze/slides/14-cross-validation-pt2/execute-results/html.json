She is a Professor of Biostatistics at the Mayo Clinic. With close to 200 publications, she has worked closely with clinicians, with particular focus on women's health and psychology. Across the medical spectrum, Dr.Â Enders has provided advanced statistical modeling collaboration in clinical trials.*\n\n*She is also passionate about biostatistics education and works to dissolve the hidden curriculum for research, particularly statistical knowledge needed for non-statisticians.*\n:::\n:::\n\nSource: [hardin47.github.io/CURV/scholars/enders](https://hardin47.github.io/CURV/scholars/enders.html)\n\n## Felicity Enders {.midi}\n\nDr. Enders was a statistician on an interdisciplinary research team that used logistic regression to identify demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables associated with the presence (or absence) of advanced fibrosis with the aim to create a scoring system that could be used by clinicians.\n\n*\"Data from each of the **4 countries were randomly separated into 2/3 and 1/3 of patients for model building and model validation, respectively**. Hence, data on 480 patients were used to build a model, whereas data on 253 patients were used to validate the model.\"*\n\n*\"...cross-validation was used with 20 subgroups, so that at most 5% of the data under consideration was excluded at any one time. **By employing cross-validation, the possibility of an unusually positive or negative validation subset could be assessed.**\"*\n\nAngulo, Paul, et al. \"[The NAFLD fibrosis score: a noninvasive system that identifies liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD](https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.21496).\" *Hepatology* 45.4 (2007): 846-854.\n\n## Topics\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   Cross validation application exercise\n:::\n\n## Computational setup\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(countdown)\nlibrary(rms)\n\n# set default theme and larger font size for ggplot2\nggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Data: Restaurant tips\n\nWhich variables help us predict the amount customers tip at a restaurant?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 169 Ã— 5\n     Tip Party Meal   Age    Alcohol\n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  \n 1  2.99     1 Dinner Yadult No     \n 2  2        1 Dinner Yadult No     \n 3  5        1 Dinner SenCit No     \n 4  4        3 Dinner Middle No     \n 5 10.3      2 Dinner SenCit No     \n 6  4.85     2 Dinner Middle No     \n 7  5        4 Dinner Yadult No     \n 8  4        3 Dinner Middle No     \n 9  5        2 Dinner Middle No     \n10  1.58     1 Dinner SenCit No     \n# â„¹ 159 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Variables\n\n**Predictors**:\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   `Party`: Number of people in the party\n-   `Meal`: Time of day (Lunch, Dinner, Late Night)\n-   `Age`: Age category of person paying the bill (Yadult, Middle, SenCit)\n-   `Alcohol`: Whether the party ordered alcohol with the meal (Yes, No)\n:::\n\n**Outcome**: `Tip`: Amount of tip\n\n## Outcome: `Tip`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-cross-validation-pt2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=3000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Predictors\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-cross-validation-pt2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){fig-align='center' width=3000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Outcome vs. predictors\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](14-cross-validation-pt2_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=3600}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis goal {.midi}\n\n::: question\nUse cross validation to evaluate and select a model to predict the tip amount\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**v-fold cross validation** -- commonly used resampling technique:\n\n-   Randomly split your **training** **data** into ***v*** partitions\n-   Use ***v-1*** partitions for analysis, and the remaining 1 partition for assessment\n-   Repeat ***v*** times, updating which partition is used for assessment each time\n\n# Application exercise\n\n::: appex\nðŸ“‹ <https://sta210-fa23.netlify.app/ae/ae-11-cross-validation>\n:::\n\n# Inference for multiple linear regression\n\n## Modeling workflow\n\n-   Split data into training and test sets.\n\n-   Use cross validation on the training set to fit, evaluate, and compare candidate models.
