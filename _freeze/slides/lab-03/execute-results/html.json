You can't have the same name as another team in the class, so be creative!\n\n    -   Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.\n\n-   Fill out the team agreement. The goals of the agreement are to...\n\n    -   Gain a common understanding of the team's goals and expectations for collaboration\n    -   Make a plan for team communication\n    -   Make a plan for working outside of lab\n\n## Team workflow\n\n-   Only <u>**one**</u> team member should type at a time. There are markers in today's lab to help you determine whose turn it is to type.\n\n    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.\n\n-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.\n\n    ::: callout-important\n    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Read the submission instructions carefully!**\n    :::\n\n## Team workflow, in action\n\n-   Complete the \"Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\" section of the lab in your teams.\n-   Raise your hand if you have any questions about the workflow.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_13b52932\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;font-size:2em;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">05</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Tips for working on a team {.midi}\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.\n\n-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.\n\n## Lab 03: Multiple linear regression\n\nTodayâ€™s lab focuses on using multiple linear regression to predict childcare costs for preschool-aged children in North Carolina.\n\nðŸ”— [sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab-03.html](../labs/lab-03.html)\n",
