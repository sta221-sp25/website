You may write any mathematical work by hand and attach it to the rendered PDF before uploading to Gradescope.\n\n-   This lab will be graded for completion. You will receive feedback so you know what to expect in future assignments. See [Grading](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab-01#grading-50-pts) for more detail\n\n## Tips for working on lab\n\n-   Labs will always be due **Tuesdays at 11:59pm**, but you are encouraged to complete as much as you can during the lab session.\n\n-   One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging during lab when a TA can help you on the spot.\n\n-   For today's lab, start with the material you most need to review - computing or linear algebra concepts.\n\n    -   We will begin using the linear algebra concepts in class on January 21.\n\n## Workflow and formatting\n\nPart of the lab grade is for ‚Äúworkflow and formatting‚Äù assessing the reproducible workflow and document format. This includes\n\n-   Having at least 3 informative commit messages (practicing version control)\n\n    -   There are markers in Lab 01 to help you incorporate version control in your workflow\n\n-   The PDF is neatly organized document with clear exercise headings and readable code and narrative\n\n-   The name (first and last) and date are updated at the top of the document.\n\n## **When you‚Äôre done with lab**\n\n-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo\n\n-   Submit your final PDF to Gradescope\n\n    -   Combine the rendered Quarto document and handwritten math work into a single PDF document if needed.\n\n    -   Access Gradescope through the course Canvas site\n\n    -   Mark the pages associated with each exercise.\n\n## Getting started \n\nAsk your TA if\n\n-   You do not have a `lab-01` repo in the GitHub course organization: [github.com/sta221-sp25](https://github.com/sta221-sp25)\n\n-   You need help cloning the repo and starting a new RStudio project\n\nüîó [sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab‚Äì01.html](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab‚Äì01.html)\n",
