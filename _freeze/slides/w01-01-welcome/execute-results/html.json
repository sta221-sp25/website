It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.\"\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)\n:::\n\n# STA 210 \n\n## Course FAQ\n\n**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**\n\nA - Introductory statistics or probability course at Duke\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we be doing computing?**\n\nA - Yes. We will use the computing language R\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**\n\nA - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression. There is a new 1-credit course [STA 211: Mathematics of Regression](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/mathematics-regression) to take simultaneously or after this course to dive into more of the mathematics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Course learning objectives\n\n-   Analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.\n\n-   Fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.\n\n-   Assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.\n\n-   Use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.\n\n-   Communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience.\n\n## Course topics \n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Unit 1: Quantitative Response Variables**\n\n-   Simple Linear Regression\n\n-   Multiple Linear Regression\n\n**Unit 2: Categorical Response Variable**\n\n-   Logistic Regression\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Unit 3: Looking Ahead**\n\n-   Mixed and random effects\n\n-   Introduction to linear mixed models\n\n-   Presenting statistical results\n:::\n:::\n\n## Examples of regression in practice\n\n-   [New Yorkers Will Pay \\$56 A Month To Trim A Minute Off Their Commute](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/)\n\n-   [How FiveThirtyEight's 2020 Presidential Forecast Works --- And What's Different Because Of COVID-19](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/)\n\n-   [Effect of Forensic Evidence on Criminal Justice Case Processing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12020)\n\n-   [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)\n\n# Course overview\n\n## Course toolkit\n\n-   **Course website**: [sta210-fa21.netlify.app](https://sta210-fa21.netlify.app/)\n    -

You\\'ll also be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\n\n-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don\\'t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.\n\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n:::\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I\\'m always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don\\'t hesitate to let me know.\n\n# Course policies\n\n## Covid policies\n\n-   ðŸ˜· Wear a mask at all times in lectures and labs.\n\n-   Read and follow the [university guidelines](https://coronavirus.duke.edu/guidelines-requirements/)\n\n## Late work, waivers, and regrade requests\n\n-   We have policies!\n\n-   Read about them in the [syllabus](../../syllabus.qmd) and refer back to them as needed\n\n## Collaboration & sharing code\n\n-   We have policies!\n\n-   Read about them in the [syllabus](../../syllabus.qmd) and refer to them as needed\n\n-   We'll discuss these more before the first assignments\n\n## Academic integrity \n\n> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\n>\n> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\n>\n> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\n>\n> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\\\nBy participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the Duke Community Standard.\n\n## If you're not sure...\n\nAsk if you\\'re not sure if something violates a policy!\n\n# Being successful in STA 210 \n\n## Five tips for success\n\n1.  Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions.\n\n3.  Do the homework and lab.\n\n4.  Don\\'t procrastinate and don\\'t let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements (posted on Sakai & sent via email).\n\n## Learning during a pandemic\n\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don\\'t hesitate to ask.\n\n-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you\\'re always welcome to talk to me. If I can\\'t help, I likely know someone who can.\n\n-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded.\n\nSee the [Course Support](../../support.qmd) page for information on Duke's academic and wellness resources.\n\n# Questions?\n\n# Let's look at some data!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Let's take a look at the [Movies budgets vs. revenues](https://sta210-fa21.netlify.app/appex/ae-01-movies.html) analysis. - Move to a GitHub repo\n\n-   You may discuss with your neighbor.
