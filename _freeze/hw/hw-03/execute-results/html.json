You will also examine model diagnostics and variable transformations.\n\n# Learning goals\n\nIn this assignment, you will…\n\n-   use model diagnostics to identify influential points.\n-   examine multicollinearity and consider strategies to handle it.\n-   fit and interpret models with transformed variables.\n\n# Getting started\n\n-   Go to the [sta221-sp25](https://www.github.com/sta221-sp25) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **hw-03**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [Lab 00 instructions](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab-00.html#getting-started) for details on cloning a repo and starting a new project in R.\n\n# Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in this assignment:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(rms)\n\n# load other packages as needed\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Conceptual exercises[^1]\n\n[^1]: Exercise 2 is adapted from @montgomery2021introduction .\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe conceptual exercises are focused on explaining concepts and showing results mathematically. Show your work for each question.\\\n\\\n**You may write the answers and associated work for conceptual exercises by hand or type them in your Quarto document.**\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nSuppose we have a model of the form\n\n$$\n\\log(y_i) =\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\log(x_i) + \\epsilon_i \\hspace{10mm} \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\n$$\n\nDescribe the expected change in $y_i$ when $x_i$ is multiplied by a constant $C$. Show the work used to obtain the expected change.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nSuppose we have a model of the form\n\n$$\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i, \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\epsilon x_i^2)\n$$\n\na.  This model violates which model assumption? Briefly explain why.\nb.  Suppose you refit the model with the transformation on $y$, $y^\\prime = y / x$ . Show that this is a variance-stabilizing transformation, i.e., that the variance of the response does not depend on $x$.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFor each of the following regression models, state whether it can be expressed in the form of a linear model by applying a suitable transformation to both sides of the equation. If so, write the equation for the transformed model.\n\na.  $y_i = \\log(\\beta_1x_{i1}) + \\beta_2x_{i2} + \\epsilon_i$\n\nb.  $y_i = [1 + e^{(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\epsilon_i)}]^{-1}$\n\n# Applied exercises\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe applied exercises are focused on applying the concepts to analyze data.\n\n**All work for the applied exercises must be typed in your Quarto document following a reproducible workflow.**\n\nWrite all narrative using complete sentences and include informative axis labels / titles on visualizations.\n\n## Data: Age of abalones\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe data for this analysis contains measurements for abalones, a type of marine snail. These measurements were collected and analyzed by researchers in @warwick1994population. [Click here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Warwick-Nash/publication/287546509_7he_Population_Biology_of_Abalone_Haliotis_species_in_Tasmania_I_Blacklip_Abalone_H_rubra_from_the_North_Coast_and_Islands_of_Bass_Strait/links/5d949460458515202b7bf592/7he-Population-Biology-of-Abalone-Haliotis-species-in-Tasmania-I-Blacklip-Abalone-H-rubra-from-the-North-Coast-and-Islands-of-Bass-Strait.pdf) for the publication.\n\nThe 4177 abalones in this study can be reasonably treated as a random sample.\n\nThe data are available in the file `abalone.csv` in the `data` folder. This analysis will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `Sex`: Male (M), Female (F), Infant (I)\n\n-   `Length`: Longest shell measurement (in millimeters)\n\n-   `Diameter`: Measured perpendicular to length (in millimeters)\n\n-   `Height` : Measured with meat in shell (in millimeters)\n\n-   `Whole_Weight`: Total weight of abalone (in grams)\n\n-   `Age`: Age (in year)\n\n**The goal of the analysis is to use a variety of measurements from abalones to explain variability in the age.**\n\n## Exercise 4\n\na.  Fit a model using `Sex`, `Length`, `Diameter`, `Height` and `Whole_Weight` to understand variability in `Age`. Neatly display the model using 3 digits.\nb.  Check the four model conditions - Linearity, Constant Variance, Normality, and Independence. For each condition: (1) state whether or not it is satisfied; (2) explain your response showing any visualizations and/or statistics used to make your assessment.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nNow let's take a look at the model diagnostics.\n\na.  Are there any influential observations in the data set? Briefly explain, showing any work or output used to make the determination.\nb.  Consider the observation with the highest value for Cook’s distance. What is the value of leverage for this observation? Does this observation have large leverage? Briefly explain, showing any work or output used to make the determination.\nc.  Again consider the observation with the highest value for Cook’s distance. What is the standardized residual for this observation? Is this observation an outlier? Briefly explain showing any work or output used to make the determination.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nNow let's look at the relationship between predictors.\n\na.  Compute the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for the model from Exercise 4. Display the results.\nb.  Use the equation for VIF to \"manually\" compute the VIF for `Whole_Weight`.\nc.  What predictors appear to be collinear?\nd.  Select a strategy to fit a model that does not have an issue with multicollinearity.\n    -   Briefly describe your strategy.\n    -   Select a final model.\n    -   Briefly explain your selection, showing the work and statistics used to choose a final model.\n\n## Data: 2000 U.S. Presidential Election[^2]\n\n[^2]: This analysis was motivated by exercises in @ledolter2003statistical.\n\n<!--# motivated by Statistical Sleuth-->\n\nWe will examine data about the [2000 U.S. presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election) between George W. Bush and Al Gore. It was one of the closest elections in history that ultimately came down to the state of Florida. One county in particular, Palm Beach County, was at the center of the controversy due to the design of their ballots - the infamous [butterfly ballots](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/americas/2000/us_elections/glossary/a-b/1037172.stm). It is believed that many people who intended to vote for Al Gore accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan due to how the spots to mark the candidate were arranged next to the names.\n\nThe variables in the data are\n\n-   `County`: County name\n\n-   `Bush2000`: Number of votes for George W. Bush\n\n-   `Buchanan2000`: Number of votes for Pat Buchanan\n\nThe data are available in the file `florida-votes-2000.csv` in the `data` folder of your repo.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nThe goal is to fit a model that uses the number of votes for Bush to predict the number of votes for Buchanan. Using this model, we’ll investigate whether the data support the claim that votes for Gore may have accidentally gone to Buchanan.\n\na.  Visualize the relationship between the number of votes for Buchanan versus the number of votes for Bush. Describe what you observe in the visualization, including a description of the relationship between the votes for Buchanan and votes for Bush.\nb.  What is the county with the extreme outlier number of votes for Buchanan? Create a new data frame that doesn’t include the outlying county. **You will use this updated data frame for the remainder of this exercise and Exercise 8.**\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nNow let's consider potential models with transformations on the response and/or predictor variables. The four candidate models are the following:\n\n| Model | Response variable | Predictor variable |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| 1     | Buchanan2000      | Bush2000           |\n| 2     | log(Buchanan2000) | Bush2000           |\n| 3     | Buchanan2000      | log(Bush2000)      |\n| 4     | log(Buchanan2000) | log(Bush2000)      |\n\nWhich model best fits the data? Briefly explain, showing any work and output used to determine the response. **(Note: Use the data set without the outlying county to find the candidate models.)**\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nNow we will use the model to predict the expected number of Buchanan votes for the outlier county.\n\nSuppose the observed value of the predictor for this county (a new observation) is $x_0$. We define $\\mathbf{x}_0^\\mathsf{T} = [1, x_0]$\n\nThen the predicted response is\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}_0 = \\mathbf{x}_0^\\mathsf{T}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is the vector of estimated model coefficients.\n\nJust as there is uncertainty in our model coefficients, there is uncertainty in our predictions as well. We use a confidence interval to quantify the uncertainty for a model coefficient, and we can use a **prediction interval** to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction for a new observation.\n\nThe $C\\%$ prediction interval for the new observation is\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}_0 \\pm t^*_{n - p - 1}\\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2_\\epsilon(1 + \\mathbf{x}_0^\\mathsf{T}(\\mathbf{X}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{x}_0)}\n$$\n\nwhere $t^*_{n-p-1}$ is the critical value obtained from the $t$ distribution with $n - p - 1$ degrees of freedom, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix for the model, and $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_\\epsilon$ is the estimated variability about the regression line.\n\na.  Use the model you chose in the previous exercise to compute the predicted number of votes for Buchanan in the outlying county identified in Exercise 7. If you selected a model with a transformation, be sure to report your answer in terms of votes, not log(votes).\n\nb.  Use the formula above to \"manually\" compute the 95% prediction interval for this county (do not obtain the interval using the `predict` function) . If you selected a model with a transformation, be sure to report your answer in terms of votes, not log(votes).\n\nc.  It is assumed that some of the votes for Buchanan in that county were actually intended to be for Gore. Based on your results in the previous question, does your model support this claim?\n\n    -   If no, briefly explain.\n\n    -   If yes, about how many votes were possibly intended for Gore? Show any calculations and output used to determine your answer. If you selected a model with a transformation, be sure to report your answer in terms of votes, not log(votes).\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.
