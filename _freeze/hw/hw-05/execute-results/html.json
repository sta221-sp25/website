A., & Carlson, M. A. (2014). [An evaluation of lineup presentation, weapon presence, and a distinctive feature using ROC analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211368114000229). *Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition*, *3*(2), 45-53\n\n## Learning goals\n\nIn this assignment, you will...\n\n-   Fit and interpret multinomial logistic regression models.\n\n-   Evaluate conditions for multinomial logistic regression\n\n-   Continue developing a workflow for reproducible data analysis.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe repo for this assignment is available on GitHub at [github.com/sta210-fa23](https://github.com/sta210-fa23 \"Course GitHub organization\") and starts with the prefix **hw-05**. See [Lab 01](../labs/lab-01.html) for more detailed instructions on getting started.\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages will be used for this assignment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# add other packages as needed\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Data\n\nFor this assignment, we will analyze data from the eye witness identification experiment in [Carlson and Carlson (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368114000229). In this experiment, participants were asked to watch a video of a mock crime (from the first person perspective), spend a few minutes completing a random task, and then identify the perpetrator of the mock crime from a line up shown on the screen. Every lineup in this analysis included the true perpetrator from the video. After viewing the line-up , each participant could make one of the following decisions (**`id`**):\n\n-   **correct**: correctly identified the true perpetrator\n-   **foil**: incorrectly identified the \"foil\", i.e. a person who looks very similar to the perpetrator\n-   **reject**: incorrectly concluded the true perpetrator is not in the lineup\n\nThe main objective of the analysis is to understand how different conditions of the mock crime and suspect lineup affect the decision made by the participant. We will consider the following conditions to describe the decisions:\n\n-   **`lineup`**: How potential suspects are shown to the participants\n    -   **Simultaneous Lineup**: Participants were shown photos of all 6 potential suspects at the same time and were required to make a single decision (identify someone from the lineup or reject the lineup).\n    -   **Sequential 5 Lineup**: Photos of the 6 suspects were shown one at a time. The participant was required to make a decision (choose or don't choose) as each photo was shown. Once a decision was made, participants were not allowed to reexamine a photo. If the participant made an identification, the remaining photos were not shown. In each of these lineups the true perpetrator was always the 5<sup>th</sup> photo in the lineup.\n-   **`weapon`**: Whether or not a weapon was present in the video of the mock crime.\n-   **`feature`**: Whether or not the perpetrator had a distinctive marking on his face. In this experiment, the distinctive feature was a large \"N\" sticker on one cheek. (The letter \"N\" was chosen to represent the first author's alma mater - University of Nebraska.)\n\nThe data may be found in `eyewitness.csv` in the `data` folder.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\new <- read_csv(\"data/eyewitness.csv\")\new <- ew |>\n  mutate(id = as_factor(id))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nLet's begin by doing some exploratory data analysis. The univariate plots for each of the predictor variables and the response variable are shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nComplete the exploratory data analysis by creating the plots and/or summary statistics to examine the relationship between the response variable (`id`) and each of the explanatory variables (`lineup`, `weapon`, and `feature`).\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nUsing the plots/tables from Question 1:\n\n-   What is one thing you learn about the data from the univariate plots?\n-   Based on the bivariate plots, do any of the predictors appear to have a significant effect on the `id`? Briefly explain.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nBriefly explain why you should use a multinomial logistic regression model to predict `id` using `lineup`, `weapon` and `feature`.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nFit the multinomial logistic model that only includes main effects. Display the model output.\n\n-   What is the baseline category for the response variable?\n-   Interpret the intercepts for each part of the model in terms of the odds.\n-   Interpret the coefficients of `lineup` for each part of the model in terms of the odds.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nYou want to consider all possible interaction effects for the model.\n\n-   Use the appropriate test to determine if there is at least one significant interaction effect.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Based on your test, is there evidence of any significant interaction effects? Briefly explain.\n\n::: callout-important\n*Regardless of your answer to Question 5, use the model that includes the interaction terms for the remainder of the assignment.*\n:::\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nAccording to the model,\n\n-   If there was no weapon but the perpetrator had a distinctive feature in the mock crime, how do the **log-odds** of reject vs. a correct ID change when there is a simultaneous lineup vs. a sequential lineup?\n-   If there was no weapon but the perpetrator had a distinctive feature in the mock crime, how do the **odds** of reject vs. a correct ID change when there is a simultaneous lineup vs. a sequential lineup?\n-   Which group of participants (i.e. which set of experimental conditions) is described by the intercept?\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nAre the conditions for inference met? List the conditions, and, **if relevant**, create visualizations to check the conditions and evaluate whether each condition is met. Include an assessment about each condition and a brief explanation about your conclusion.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nUse the model to predict the decision made by each participant. Make a table of the predicted vs.the actual decisions.\n\n-   Briefly describe how the predicted decision is determined for each participant.\n-   What is the misclassification rate?\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.
