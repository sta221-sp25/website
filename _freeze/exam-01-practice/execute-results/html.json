This set of practice problems is <u>**not**</u> comprehensive. You should review these [study tips](/slides/10-inference-pt3#/tips-for-studying) as you prepare for the exam.\\\n\\\nThere is no answer key for these problems. You may ask questions in office hours and on Ed Discussion.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use data from `nrow(penguins)` penguins at Palmer Station in Antartica to fit linear regression model model using species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo), flipper length (in millimeters), and bill depth (in millimeters) to predict its body mass (in grams). [Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) to read more about the variables.\n\nThe linear regression model has the form\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n$$Write the dimensions of $\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ specifically for this analysis.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nThe output for the model described in Exercise 1, along with 95% confidence intervals for the model coefficients, is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins_fit <- lm(body_mass_g ~ species + flipper_length_mm + \n                     bill_depth_mm + body_mass_g, \n                   data = penguins)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts): the response appeared on\nthe right-hand side and was dropped\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning in model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts): problem with term 4 in\nmodel.matrix: no columns are assigned\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy(penguins_fit,conf.int = TRUE) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term              |  estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|  conf.low| conf.high|\n|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|\n|(Intercept)       | -4526.887|   516.931|    -8.757|   0.000| -5543.705| -3510.068|\n|speciesChinstrap  |  -131.968|    51.400|    -2.567|   0.011|  -233.073|   -30.863|\n|speciesGentoo     |  1288.968|   132.774|     9.708|   0.000|  1027.798|  1550.138|\n|flipper_length_mm |    25.700|     3.098|     8.295|   0.000|    19.606|    31.794|\n|bill_depth_mm     |   182.364|    18.358|     9.934|   0.000|   146.252|   218.475|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Interpret the coefficient of `flipper_length_mm` in the context of the data.\n\n-   What is the baseline category for `speices`?\n\n-   Interpret the coefficient of `speciesChinstrap` in the context of the data.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\n-   Does the intercept have a meaningful interpretation?\n\n-   If not, what are some strategies we can use to fit a model such that the intercept is meaningful?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nThere are three species in the data set (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo), but only two terms for species in the model. Use the design matrix to show why we cannot put indicators for all three species and the intercept in the model.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nWe conduct the following hypothesis test for the coefficient of `flipper_length_mm`.\n\n-   **Null:** There is no linear relationship between flipper length and body mass, after accounting for species and bill depth\n\n-   **Alternative**: There is a linear relationship between flipper length and body mass, after accounting for species and bill depth\n\na.  Write these hypotheses in mathematical notation.\nb.  The standard error is 3.098. Explain how this value is computed and what this value means in the context of the data.\nc.  The test statistic is 8.295. Explain how this value is computed and what this value means in the context of the data.\nd.  What distribution is used to compute the p-value?\ne.  What is the conclusion from the test in the context of the data?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n1.  Interpret the 95% confidence interval for `flipper_length_mm` in the context of the data.\n2.  Is the interval consistent with the test from the previous exercise? Briefly explain.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nSketch a scatterplot of the relationship between bill depth and body mass such that the effect of bill depth differs by species.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nWhen we conduct inference for regression, we assume the following distribution for $\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}$\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X} \\sim(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2_\\epsilon\\mathbf{I})\n$$\n\na.  Show that $E(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$\nb.  Show that $Var(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X})= \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{I}$\n\nSee February 4 lecture [\"Inference for Regression\"](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/08-inference#/title-slide) to check your work.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nWe conduct inference on the coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ assuming that the variability of $\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{X}$ is constant for value (or combination) of predictors. Briefly explain why is assumption is important.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nGiven the model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, derive the least-squares estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ using matrix calculus.\n\nSee January 21 lecture [\"SLR: Matrix representation\"](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/04-slr-matrix#/title-slide) to check your work.\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nGiven the model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, derive the least-squares estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ using the geometric interpretation of the model.\n\nSee January 23 lecture [\"Geometric interpretation of least-squares regression\"](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/05-geometry#/title-slide) to check your work.\n\n## Exercise 12\n\nExplain why we say \"holding all else constant\" when interpreting the coefficients in a multiple linear regression model.\n\n## Exercise 13\n\nSuppose we have two models:\n\n-   Model 1 includes predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$\n\n-   Model 2 includes predictors $X_1, X_2, X_3$ and $X_4$\n\nExplain why we should use $Adj. R^2$ and not $R^2$ to compare these models.\n\n## Exercise 14\n\nRework Exercises 1 - 5 in [HW 01](/hw/hw-01.html) for more practice with theory and math.\n\n## Exercise 15\n\nRework Exercises 1 - 5 in [HW 02](/hw/hw-02.html) for more practice with theory and math.\n\n## Relevant lectures, assignments and AEs\n\nAsk yourself \"why\" questions as you the slides, review your answers, process, and derivations on these assignments.
