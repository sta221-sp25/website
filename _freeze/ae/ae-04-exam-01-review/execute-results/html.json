How many indicator variables for `Age` can we create from the data?\nb.  How many indicator variables for `Age` will be in the regression model?\nc.  Are the responses to parts a and b equal? If not, explain why not.\nd.  Which of the following is true for this model? Select all that apply.\n    i.  The intercepts are the same for every level of `Age`.\n    ii.

What is the dimension of the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ for the main effects model?\n\nb.  Calculate the coefficient estimates $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ directly from the data.\n\nc.  Write the equation of the estimated regression model.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nCompute the following directly from the data:\n\na.

The effect of `Party` is the same for every level of `Age`.\n    iv. The effect of `Party` differs by `Age`.\nb.  By how much does the intercept for tables with young adult payers differ from tables with middle age payers?\nc.  Write the equation of the model for tables in which the payer is a senior citizen.\nd.  Suppose you wish to test the hypotheses: $H_0: \\beta_5 = 0 \\text{ vs. }H_a: \\beta_5 \\neq 0$ . State what is being tested in terms of the effect of `Party`.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nThe output for the model with the interaction term and 90% confidence intervals for the coefficients is shown below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntip_int_fit <- lm(Tip ~ Party + Age + Party * Age, data = tips)\ntidy(tip_int_fit, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.9) |>\n  kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term            | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value| conf.low| conf.high|\n|:---------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|--------:|---------:|\n|(Intercept)     |    0.604|     0.504|     1.199|   0.232|   -0.229|     1.438|\n|Party           |    1.924|     0.169|    11.359|   0.000|    1.644|     2.204|\n|AgeSenCit       |    1.033|     0.784|     1.317|   0.190|   -0.265|     2.330|\n|AgeYadult       |   -1.203|     0.928|    -1.297|   0.197|   -2.739|     0.332|\n|Party:AgeSenCit |   -0.259|     0.262|    -0.986|   0.325|   -0.692|     0.175|\n|Party:AgeYadult |    0.199|     0.504|     0.395|   0.693|   -0.635|     1.034|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\na.
