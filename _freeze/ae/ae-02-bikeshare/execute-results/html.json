This AE does not count towards the Application Exercise grade.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nOur dataset contains daily rentals from the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC in 2011 and 2012. It was obtained from the `dcbikeshare` data set in the dsbox R package.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables in the analysis:\n\n-   `count`: total bike rentals\n-   `temp_orig`: Temperature in degrees Celsius\n-   `season`: 1 - winter, 2 - spring, 3 - summer, 4 - fall\n\nClick [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/dcbikeshare.html) for the full list of variables and definitions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbikeshare <- read_csv(\"data/dcbikeshare.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Daily counts and temperature\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nVisualize the distribution of daily bike rentals and temperature as well as the relationship between these two variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- ggplot(bikeshare, aes(x = count)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250) + \n  labs(x = \"Daily bike rentals\")\n\np2 <- ggplot(bikeshare, aes(x = temp_orig)) +\n  geom_histogram() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature (Celsius)\")\n\np3 <- ggplot(bikeshare, aes(y = count, x = temp_orig)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"Temperature (Celsius)\", \n       y = \"Daily bike rentals\")\n\n(p1 | p2) / p3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bikeshare_files/figure-html/bike-temp-viz-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nDescribe the relationship between daily bike rentals and temperature. Comment on how we expect the number of bike rentals to change as the temperature increases.\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nSuppose you want to fit a model so you can use the temperature to predict the number of bike rentals. Would a model of the form\n\n$$\\text{count} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 ~ \\text{temp\\_orig} + \\epsilon$$\n\nbe an appropriate fit for the data? Why or why not?\n\nPut your group's vote on Ed Discussion and briefly describe your reasoning in the comments.\n\n-   Section 001 (10:05am): [edstem.org/us/courses/44523/discussion/3361086](https://edstem.org/us/courses/44523/discussion/3361086)\n\n-   Section 002 (1:25pm): [edstem.org/us/courses/44523/discussion/3361091](https://edstem.org/us/courses/44523/discussion/3361091)\n",
