The responses are due in your GitHub repo no later than Saturday, November 11 at 11:59pm.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Response to Leukemia treatment\n\nToday's data is from a study where 51 untreated adult patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who were given a course of treatment, and they were assessed as to their response to the treatment.[^1]\n\n[^1]: The data set is from the Stat2Data R package. This AE is adapted from exercises in *Stat 2.*\n\nThe goal of today's analysis is to use pre-treatment factors to predict how likely it is a patient will respond to the treatment.\n\nWe will use the following variables:\n\n-   `Age`: Age at diagnosis (in years)\n-   `Smear`: Differential percentage of blasts\n-   `Infil`: Percentage of absolute marrow leukemia infiltrate\n-   `Index`: Percentage labeling index of the bone marrow leukemia cells\n-   `Blasts`: Absolute number of blasts, in thousands\n-   `Temp`: Highest temperature of the patient prior to treatment, in degrees Fahrenheit\n-   `Resp`: 1 = responded to treatment or 0 = failed to respond\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleukemia <- read_csv(\"data/leukemia.csv\") |>\n  mutate(Resp = factor(Resp))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Comparing models\n\n1.  Consider a model with all the pre-treatment variables: `Age`, `Smear`, `Infil`, `Index`, `Blasts` and `Temp`. Fit a model using these six variables to predict whether a patient responded to the treatment. Call the model `full_model`. Display the model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Based on the model, which pre-treatment variables are statistically significant using a threshold of $\\alpha = 0.05$? (We will talk more about inference for logistic regression coefficients in an upcoming lecture.)\n\n3.  Fit a model that only includes the statistically significant predictors. Call the model `reduced_model`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n4.  Use a drop-in-deviance test to compare a model that includes only the significant predictors to the full model. Which model do you choose based on the results of this test?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n5.  Is your choice based on AIC consistent with your choice from the previous exercise? What about a choice based on BIC?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Push all your work to your `ae-14` repo on GitHub. (You do not submit AEs on Gradescope).\n:::\n",
