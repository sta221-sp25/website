Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station. The data were collected from by [Pioneer Valley Planning Commission](http://www.fvgreenway.org/pdfs/Northampton-Bikepath-Volume-Counts%20_05_LTA.pdf) via the **mosaicData** package.\n\nWe will use the following variables in this analysis:\n\n**Outcome**:\n\n-   `volume` estimated number of trail users that day (number of breaks recorded)\n\n**Predictors**\n\n-   `hightemp` daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)\n\n-   `avgtemp` average of daily low and daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)\n\n-   `season` one of ‚ÄúFall‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù\n\n-   `precip` measure of precipitation (in inches)\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrail_trail <- read_csv(\"data/rail_trail.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n-   Fit the regression model using high temperature, average temperature, season, and precipitation to predict volume.\n\n-   Are there any coefficients that may be not what you expected?\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nUse the formula\n\n$$\nVIF_j = \\frac{1}{1 - R^2_j} \n$$\n\nto calculate the VIF for `avgtemp`.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nBased on the VIF from the previous exercise, does `avgtemp` have a linear dependency with one or more other predictors? Explain.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n-   Use the `vif` function to compute VIF for the predictors in Exercise 1.\n\n-   Are there predictors with near-linear dependencies? If so, which ones?\n\n# Part 2\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nLet's address the issue of mulitcollinearity. Choose a strategy to address the multicollinearity. Then, select a final model.\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\nRender the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n\nPush all your work to your AE repo on GitHub.
