Use lecture notes notes, application exercises, labs, and homework for a comprehensive exam review.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Part 1: Logistic regression\n\n## Data\n\nThe data for this analysis is about credit card customers. It can be found in the file `credit.csv`. The following variables are in the data set:\n\n-   `income`: Income in \\$1,000's\n-   `limit`: Credit limit\n-   `rating`: Credit rating\n-   `cards`: Number of credit cards\n-   `age`: Age in years\n-   `education`: Number of years of education\n-   `own`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual owns their home\n-   `student`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual was a student\n-   `married`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual was married\n-   `region`: A factor with levels `South`, `East`, and `West` indicating the region of the US the individual is from\n-   `balance`: Average credit card balance in \\$.\n\n**The objective of this analysis is to predict whether a person has maxed out their credit card, i.e., had \\$0 average card balance.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncredit <- read_csv(\"data/credit.csv\") |>\n  mutate(maxed = factor(if_else(balance == 0, 1, 0)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n-   Why is logistic regression the best modeling approach for this analysis?\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Fill in the blanks. In logistic regression, we\n\n    -   use log-odds to ...\n\n    -   use odds to ...\n\n    -   use probabilities to ...\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nSplit the data into 80% training and 20% test sets. Use seed 210.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(210)\ncredit_split <- initial_split(credit, prop = 0.8)\ncredit_train <- training(credit_split)\ncredit_test <- testing(credit_split)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSpecify the logistic regression model. Call it `credit_spec`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nCreate a recipe called `credit_rec` that does the following:\n\n-   Predict `maxed` using `income`, `age`, and `student`.\n-   Mean center the quantitative predictors.\n-   Create dummy variables where needed and drop any zero variance variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncredit_rec <- recipe(maxed ~ income + age + student, \n                     data = credit_train)\n\n# add recipe steps\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nCreate the workflow that brings together the model specification and recipe. Call it `credit_wflow`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nConduct 5-fold cross validation. Use seed 210 to create the folds.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, summarize the metrics from your CV resamples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nCreate a workflow for another model with a new recipe that includes the variable `region` along with all the variables and recipe steps from Exercise 3. Conduct cross validation, then select a model between the two.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nFit the model you selected in the previous exercise to the entire training set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nNow let's evaluate the performance of the selected model using the testing data.\n\nCreate a confusion matrix using a cutoff probability of 0.5.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   What is the sensitivity? What does it mean in the context of the data ?\n\n-   What is the specificity? What does it mean in the context of the data?\n\n-   What is the false positive rate? What does it mean in the context of the data?\n\n-   What is the false negative rate? What does it mean in the context of the data?\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nProduce the ROC curve.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Describe how you can use this curve to select a cutoff probability (rather than just going with 0.5).\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nQuestions about checking conditions for logistic regression:\n\n-   Do we assess conditions on the training or testing set?\n\n-   Why do we not consider categorical predictors when checking linearity?\n\n-   Why do we not need to check constant variance for logistic regression?\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Push all your work to your `ae-17` repo on GitHub. (You do not submit AEs on Gradescope).\n:::\n",
