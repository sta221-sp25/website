The data is in the `loan50` data frame in the **openintro** R package.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `annual_income_th`: Annual income (in \\$1000s)\n-   `debt_to_income`: Debt-to-income ratio, i.e. the percentage of a borrower's total debt divided by their total income\n-   `verified_income`: Whether borrower's income source and amount have been verified (`Not Verified`, `Source Verified`, `Verified`)\n-   `interest_rate`: Interest rate for the loan\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to use the annual income, debt-to-income ratio, and income verification to understand variability in the interest rate on the loan.\n\nWe'll start with data prep to rescale annual income to \\$1000's and recode `verified_income` to fix an issue with the underlying data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloan50 <- loan50 |>\n   mutate(annual_income_th = annual_income / 1000, \n          verified_income = \n            case_when(verified_income == \"Not Verified\" ~ \"Not Verified\",\n                      verified_income == \"Source Verified\" ~ \"Source Verified\",\n                      verified_income == \"Verified\" ~ \"Verified\"),\n          verified_income = as_factor(verified_income)\n   )                    \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(loan50)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 50\nColumns: 19\n$ state                   <fct> NJ, CA, SC, CA, OH, IN, NY, MO, FL, FL, MD, HIâ€¦\n$ emp_length              <dbl> 3, 10, NA, 0, 4, 6, 2, 10, 6, 3, 8, 10, 10, 2,â€¦\n$ term                    <dbl> 60, 36, 36, 36, 60, 36, 36, 36, 60, 60, 36, 36â€¦\n$ homeownership           <fct> rent, rent, mortgage, rent, mortgage, mortgageâ€¦\n$ annual_income           <dbl> 59000, 60000, 75000, 75000, 254000, 67000, 288â€¦\n$ verified_income         <fct> Not Verified, Not Verified, Verified, Not Veriâ€¦\n$ debt_to_income          <dbl> 0.55752542, 1.30568333, 1.05628000, 0.57434667â€¦\n$ total_credit_limit      <int> 95131, 51929, 301373, 59890, 422619, 349825, 1â€¦\n$ total_credit_utilized   <int> 32894, 78341, 79221, 43076, 60490, 72162, 2872â€¦\n$ num_cc_carrying_balance <int> 8, 2, 14, 10, 2, 4, 1, 3, 10, 4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3â€¦\n$ loan_purpose            <fct> debt_consolidation, credit_card, debt_consolidâ€¦\n$ loan_amount             <int> 22000, 6000, 25000, 6000, 25000, 6400, 3000, 1â€¦\n$ grade                   <fct> B, B, E, B, B, B, D, A, A, C, D, A, A, A, A, Eâ€¦\n$ interest_rate           <dbl> 10.90, 9.92, 26.30, 9.92, 9.43, 9.92, 17.09, 6â€¦\n$ public_record_bankrupt  <int> 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0â€¦\n$ loan_status             <fct> Current, Current, Current, Current, Current, Câ€¦\n$ has_second_income       <lgl> FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSâ€¦\n$ total_income            <dbl> 59000, 60000, 75000, 75000, 254000, 67000, 288â€¦\n$ annual_income_th        <dbl> 59.0, 60.0, 75.0, 75.0, 254.0, 67.0, 28.8, 80.â€¦\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nWe'll start by fitting a model in which we include all levels of `verified_income`.\n\n-   Fit a model using `debt_to_income`, `annual_income_th`, and the indicator variables created below to predict `interest_rate`.\n\n-   What do you notice about the model output?
