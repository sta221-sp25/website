The data are originally from the [Human Development Database](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) and [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).\n\n-   `life_exp`: The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic income_inequality. ( from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/65#:~:text=Definition%3A,%2C%20territory%2C%20or%20geographic%20area.))\n\n-   `income_inequality`: Measure of the deviation of the distribution of income among individuals or households within a country from a perfectly equal distribution. A value of 0 represents absolute equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality (based on Gini coefficient). (from @zarulli2021)\n\n-   `health_expend`: Per capita current spending on on healthcare good sand services, expressed in respective currency - international Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollar ([from the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/4952))\n\n-   `health_pct_gdp`: Spending on healthcare goods and services, expressed as a percentage of GDP. It excludes capital health expenditures such as buildings, machinery, information technology and stocks of vaccines for emergency or outbreaks (from @zarulli2021).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlife_exp <- read_csv(\"data/life_exp.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nFit a model using income equality to understand variability in life expectancy. Neatly display the results using 3 digits.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n-   Interpret the slope in the context of the data.\n\n-   Does it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, interpret it in the context of the data. Otherwise, explain why not.\n\n# Part 2\n\nWe now want to understand the relationship between a country's healthcare expenditure and its life expectancy. The data set contains two measures for healthcare expenditure: `health_expend` and `health_pct_gdp`.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFit a model using `health_expend` to understand variability in `life_exp`. Compute $R^2$ and $RMSE$ for this model.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Interpret $R^2$ in the context of the data.\n\n-   Interpret $RMSE$ in the context for the data.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWhich measure of healthcare expenditure would you choose as a predictor of life expectancy - `health_expend` or `health_pct_gdp`? Briefly explain, using $R^2$ and/or $RMSE$ to support your choice.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Push all your work to your AE repo on GitHub.
