Levittown was built right after WWII and was the first planned suburban community built using mass production techniques.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlevittown <- read_csv(\"data/homeprices.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe variables used in this analysis are\n\n-   `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms\n-   `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms\n-   `living_area`: Total living area of the house (in square feet)\n-   `lot_size`: Total area of the lot (in square feet)\n-   `year_built`: Year the house was built\n-   `property_tax`: Annual property taxes (in USD)\n-   `sale_price`: Sales price (in USD)\n\nThe goal of the analysis is to use the characteristics of a house to understand variability in the sales price.\n\n## Exploratory data analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggpairs(levittown) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 10),\n    strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0)\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-05-mlr_files/figure-html/eda-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Linear model\n\nFit a linear model of housing prices versus the house characteristics in Levittown. Neatly display model using 3 digits.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fit model \n\n# display model with 3 digits \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Interpretation\n\n-   Interpret the coefficient of `bedrooms` in the context of the data.\n\n-   The intercept is the estimated sales price for what subset of houses? Be specific.\n\n## Prediction\n\nWhat is the predicted sale price for a house in Levittown, NY with 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1,000 square feet of living area, 6,000 square foot lot size, built in 1947 with \\$7,403 in property taxes?\n\n-   Report the predicted value and appropriate interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create tibble for new observation \n\n# prediction + interval\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Interpret the interval in the context of the data.\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Push all your work to your `ae-05-` repo on GitHub. (You do not submit AEs on Gradescope).\n:::\n",
