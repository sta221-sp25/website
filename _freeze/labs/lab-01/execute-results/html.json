To be considered on time, the following must be done by the due date:\n\n-   Final `.qmd` and `.pdf` files pushed to your GitHub repo\n-   Final `.pdf` file submitted on Gradescope\n:::\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis lab will review of some linear algebra concepts that will be used in this course and go through the computing workflow we'll use in class. The main goal is to reinforce our knowledge of matrix operations and of R and RStudio. We will use these throughout the course, both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the lecture and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.\n\n::: callout-note\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n:::\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce git and GitHub, the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.\n\n::: callout-note\nGit is a version control system (like \"Track Changes\" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n:::\n\nTo make versioning simpler, this lab is an individual assignment. In the future, you'll learn about collaborating on GitHub and producing a single lab report for your lab team. For now, concentrate on getting the basics down.\n\n## Learning goals\n\nBy the end of the lab, you will...\n\n-   Recall some basic matrix operations and linear algebra rules\n-   Be familiar with the workflow using RStudio and GitHub\n-   Gain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto\n-   Practice version control using GitHub\n-   Be able to produce visualizations and summary statistics to describe distributions\n\n# Getting Started\n\n## Clone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta221-sp25](https://github.com/sta221-sp25) organization on GitHub.\n-   Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-01**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n    -   See the [Lab 00 instructions](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab-00#connect-rstudio-and-github) if you have not set up the SSH key or configured git.\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* $\\rightarrow$ *New Project* $\\rightarrow$ *Version Control* $\\rightarrow$ *Git*.\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n-   Click `lab-01.qmd` to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n## R and R Studio\n\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\n![](images/rstudio-panes.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of RStudio IDE\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nBelow are the components of an Quarto (`.qmd`) file.\n\n![](images/quarto.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Quarto document and rendered PDF.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## YAML\n\nThe top portion of your Quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called **YAML**. It stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n::: callout-important\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.\n:::\n\n## Committing changes\n\nNow, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\n\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**. This shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\n\nIf you're happy with these changes, we'll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, **stage** your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, \"updated author name\") in the **Commit message** box. Finally, click **Commit**. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\n\nYou don't have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\n\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\n\nNow let's make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you're good to go!\n\n## Push changes\n\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\n\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have **staged** your **commit** to be pushed. click on **Push**.\n\n# Packages\n\nWe will use the following packages in today’s lab.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Computing Review\n\n# Data: Ikea furniture\n\nToday's data is all about [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/) furniture. The data was obtained from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-03/readme.md) data collection.\n\nUse the code below to read in the data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nikea <- read_csv(\"data/ikea.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe variable definitions are as follows:\n\n| variable | class | description |\n|:---------------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------|\n| item_id | double | item id which can be used later to merge with other IKEA data frames |\n| name | character | the commercial name of items |\n| category | character | the furniture category that the item belongs to (Sofas, beds, chairs, Trolleys,...) |\n| sellable_online | logical | Sellable online TRUE or FALSE |\n| link | character | the web link of the item |\n| other_colors | character | if other colors are available for the item, or just one color as displayed in the website (Boolean) |\n| short_description | character | a brief description of the item |\n| designer | character | The name of the designer who designed the item. this is extracted from the full_description column. |\n| depth | double | Depth of the item in centimeters |\n| height | double | Height of the item in centimeters |\n| width | double | Width of the item in centimeters |\n| price_usd | double | the current price in US dollars as it is shown in the website by 4/20/2020 |\n\n# Exercises\n\n**Goal**: You would like to use statistical analysis to understand better understand the expected cost for different types of furniture and how the cost is expected to change based on width.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Instructions\n\nWrite all code and narrative in your Quarto file. Write all narrative in complete sentences. Throughout the assignment, you should periodically **render** your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, **commit** the changes in the Git pane, and **push** the updated files to GitHub.\n\n::: callout-tip\nMake sure we can read all of your code in your PDF document. This means you will need to break up long lines of code. One way to help avoid long lines of code is is start a new line after every pipe (`|>`) and plus sign (`+`).\n:::\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nViewing a summary of the data is a useful starting point for data analysis, especially if the data set has a large number of observations (rows) or variables (columns). Run the code below to use the `glimpse` function to see a summary of the `ikea` data set.\n\nHow many observations are in the `ikea` data set? How many variables?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(ikea)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\nIn your \\``` lab-01.qmd` `` document you'll see that we already added the code required for the exercise as well as a sentence where you can fill in the blanks to report the answer. Use this format for the remaining exercises.\n\nAlso note that the code chunk has a label: `glimpse-data`. Labeling your code chunks is not required, but it is good practice and highly encouraged.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nWe begin each regression analysis with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help us \"get to know\" the data and examine the variable distributions and relationships between variables. We do this by visualizing the data and calculating summary statistics to describe the variables in our data set. In this lab, we will focus on data visualizations.\n\nWhen we make visualizations, we want them to be clear and suitable to present to a professional audience. This means that, at a minimum, each visualization should have **an informative title** and **informative axis labels**.\n\nFill in the code below to visualize the distribution of `price_usd`, the price in US dollars.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = _____)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"_____\",\n       y = \"_____\", \n       title = \"_____\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nUse the visualization to describe the distribution of price. In your narrative, include descriptions of the shape, approximate center, approximate spread, and any presence of outliers. Briefly explain why the median is more representative of the center of this distribution than the mean.\n\n*Note: You may compute summary statistics to more precisely describe the center and spread.*\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your lab-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. \"Completed exercises 1 - 3\"), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the check box next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nIn this course, we’ll be most interested in the relationship between two or more variables, so let’s begin by looking at the distribution of price by category. We’ll focus on two categories, `Sofas & armchairs` and `Bookcases & shelving units`, since these may be types of furniture most useful to furnish an office.\n\nFill in the code below to create a new data frame called `ikea_sub` that only includes the furniture categories of interest. We're assigning this subsetted data frame to an object with a new name, so we don't overwrite the original data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nikea_sub <- ikea |>\n  filter(_____ %in% c( \"_____\",\n                       \"_____\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, run the code below to remove observations that have that have a missing value for at least one of `width` or `price_usd`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nikea_sub <- ikea_sub |>\n  drop_na(width, price_usd)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHow many observations are in the `ikea_sub` data frame? How many variables?\n\n::: callout-important\nUse the `ikea_sub` data frame for the remainder of lab.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between the width and price of your items at Ikea in the two categories of interest. Include informative axis labels and an informative title. Use the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\nThen, recreate your visualization, but now adding color based on furniture category. Comment on your observations from this visualization.\n\n*Note: Show both visualizations in the response.*\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your lab-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. \"Completed exercises 4 - 5\"), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the check box next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n:::\n\n# Linear Algebra Review\n\n## Instructions\n\n<!--# start here-->\n\nThe conceptual exercises are focused on explaining concepts and showing results mathematically. Show your work for each question.\\\n\\\n**Put any relevant R code in the Quarto document. You may write the answers and show any associated work for conceptual exercises by hand or type them in your Quarto document using LaTex.**\n\nLet\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2\\\\\n3 & 4\\\\\n5 & 6\\end{bmatrix}, \n\\qquad\n B = \\begin{bmatrix} \n 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\qquad\nC = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 4\\\\\n2 & 5\\\\\n3 & 6\\end{bmatrix}\n\\qquad\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{11} & x_{12}& \\dots & x_{1p}\\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22}& \\dots & x_{2p}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots& \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\nx_{n1} & x_{n2}& \\dots & x_{np}\\\\\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWrite the dimensions of the following matrices:\n\ni.  $A$\n\nii. $B$\n\niii. $A^\\top$\n\niv. $\\mathbf{X}$\n\nv.  $\\mathbf{X}^\\top$\n\n## Exercise 7\n\ni\\. Which of the following is a proper matrix multiplication operation? Explain why.\n\n(a) $A\\times C$\n\n(b) $A\\times B$\n\n(c) $A^\\top \\times B$\n\n(d) $B \\times A$\n\n(e) $B^\\top \\times C$\n\n(f) $B\\times B$\n\nii\\. Perform the multiplication you chose in part (i).\n\n## Matrix operations in `R`\n\n`R` has built in matrix tools such as addition, multiplication, transpose, etc. We will now practice using these tools to review some matrix properties.\n\nWe first begin by creating matrices using `matrix()` function. We provide elements of our matrices as the `data` argument and specify how many rows our matrices have. `byrow = TRUE` allows us to fill the matrix by row.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA <- matrix(data = c(1, 2,\n                     3, 4,\n                     5, 6),\n            nrow = 3, \n            byrow = TRUE) \n\nB <- matrix(data = c(1, 1, 1, 1, \n                     0, 1, 2, 3), \n            nrow = 2,\n            byrow = TRUE)\n\nC <-  matrix(data = c(1, 4,\n                      2, 5,\n                      3, 6),\n            nrow = 3, \n            byrow = TRUE) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about `matrix()` function by typing `?matrix` in console.\n\n## Exercise 8\n\ni\\. To perform addition or subtraction, we can simply use a `+` or `-` operators.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add A and C\nA + C\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    6\n[2,]    5    9\n[3,]    8   12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nUsing `R`, find $C + A$. Is addition commutative (i.e. does $A + C = C + A$)? Show the work to support your response.\n\nii\\. In `R`, we have to use a special matrix multiplication operator, `%*%` .\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# multiply A and B\nA %*% B\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    3    5    7\n[2,]    3    7   11   15\n[3,]    5   11   17   23\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nDoes the output match your answer to **Exercise 2 (ii)**? What happens if you try to multiply $B\\times A$ in R?\n\n::: callout-warning\nMatrix multiplication is not commutative! Matrix multiplication satisfies left and right distributivity: $(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}) \\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C}$, and $\\mathbf{A}( \\mathbf{B}+ \\mathbf{C}) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{C}$, but the order here matters. $(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}) \\mathbf{C} \\neq \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A} +\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{B}$, and $\\mathbf{A}( \\mathbf{B}+ \\mathbf{C}) = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}$. Pay attention to the order and dimensions of matrices.\n:::\n\niii\\. In this class, we will work a lot with matrix transposes. You can transpose a matrix in `R` by applying `t()` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# transpose A\nt(A)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFind $B^\\top \\times A^\\top$ using R. How is your answer compare to the result of $A\\times B$ you found in previous part?\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your `lab-01` repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g., \"Completed exercises 6 - 8\"), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the check box next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nLet $\\mathbf a = \\begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf b = \\begin{bmatrix}b_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_n\\end{bmatrix}$. Recall, $$\\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{a} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2.$$\n\nWrite $(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b})^\\top (\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b})$ using summation notation.\n\n## More Linear Algebra\n\nRecall the definition of linear dependence:\n\nA sequence of vectors $\\mathbf{x_1}, \\mathbf{x_2}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x_p}$ is said to be *linearly dependent* if there exists a series of scalars $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$, not all zero, such that\n\n$$\na_1 \\mathbf{x_1} + a_2 \\mathbf{x_2} + \\dots + a_p \\mathbf{x_p} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$ Further, matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ has full column rank if all of its columns are linearly independent.\n\nFor example, the following matrix is not full rank,\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$ since, letting letting $\\mathbf{x_1} = \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{x_2} = \\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{x_3} = \\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\2 \\end{bmatrix}$, and letting $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 1$, and $a_3 = -1$, we have:\n\n$$\na_1 \\mathbf{x_1} + a_2\\mathbf{x_2} + a_3\\mathbf{x_3} =  \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\1 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nFor each of the following matrices, state whether it is full rank. If not full rank, show why (find corresponding coefficients $a$'s).\n\ni.  \n\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n    1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n    1 & 0 & 1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\nii. \n\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\niii. \n\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n     1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n     1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n     1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n\n<hr>\n\n# Matrix calculus\n\nThis section contains some additional definitions and properties that we'll use throughout this semester. There are no exercises to submit for this section.\n\n### Definition of gradient\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\x_k\\end{bmatrix}$be a $k \\times 1$ vector and $f(\\mathbf{x})$ be a function of $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nThen $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x}f$, the **gradient** of $f$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$ is\n\n$$\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{x}f = \\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_k}\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor example, if $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\end{bmatrix}$ and $f(\\mathbf{x}) = x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, then $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x}f = \\begin{bmatrix}2x_1 + x_2\\\\ x_1 + 2x_2\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n### Gradient of $\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{z}$\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x}$ be a $k \\times 1$ vector and $\\mathbf{z}$ be a $k \\times 1$ vector, such that $\\mathbf{z}$ is not a function of $\\mathbf{x}$ .\n\nThe gradient of $\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{z}$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$ is\n\n$$\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\hspace{1mm} \\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{z}\n$$\n\n### Gradient of $\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}$\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x}$ be a $k \\times 1$ vector and $\\mathbf{A}$ be a $k \\times k$ matrix, such that $\\mathbf{A}$ is not a function of $\\mathbf{x}$ .\n\nThen the gradient of $\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$ is\n\n$$\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\hspace{1mm} \\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{x}) = (\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top)\\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nIf $\\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric, then\n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top)\\mathbf{x} = 2\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nIn particular, given an $n\\times p$ matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, $\\mathbf{M^\\top M}$ is symmetric, so $$\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\hspace{1mm} \\mathbf{x}^\\top\\mathbf{M^\\top M}\\mathbf{x} = 2 \\mathbf{M^\\top M} \\mathbf{x}.\n$$\n\n::: render-commit-push\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! render, commit, and push all remaining changes.
