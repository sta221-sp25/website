You will fit and interpret the logistic regression models using training data, then use testing data to assess how well the model classifies observations into the two varieties.\n\n# Learning goals\n\nBy the end of the lab you will be able to…\n\n-   conduct exploratory data analysis for data with a binary response variable.\n\n-   fit and interpret logistic regression model.\n\n-   use relevant metrics and subject-matter context to identify a threshold for classification.\n\n-   use training and testing data to fit and assess model performance.\n\n# Getting started\n\n-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n\n-   Go to the [sta221-sp25](https://github.com/sta221-sp25) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-07**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n\n# Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nThere are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in [Lab 03](../lab-03.html). Only one person should type in the group’s .qmd file at a time to avoid merge conflicts. Once that person has finished typing the group’s responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.\n\nEvery teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.\n:::\n\n# Packages\n\nYou will use the following packages in today’s lab. Add other packages as needed.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(pROC)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nThe data in this lab contains measures describing the shape and structure of two rice varieties - *Cammeo* and *Osmancik*. To curate the data set, researchers used images from over 3,000 grains a rice in these two varieties. They then used automated methods to process the image data and extract 7 morphological features (features related to the structure) from each image. The data were originally presented and analyzed in @cinar2019classification and was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik).\n\nThis analysis will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `Class`: Cammeo or Osmancik\n\n-   `Area`: Size of the rice grain measured in pixels\n\n-   `Eccentricity`: A measure of how round the ellipse is, i.e., how close the shape of the grain is to a circle.\n\n[Click here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik) for the full data dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell lable='read-data'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrice <- read_csv(\"data/rice.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Exercises\n\n**Goal**: The goal of the analysis is to use Area and Eccentricity to identify grains from the Cammeo variety versus those from the Osmancik variety.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nWe'll begin by exploring the data. Create a scatterplot of `Area` versus `Eccentricity` with the color and shape of the points by `Class`.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nBased on the plot from the previous exercise, do you think the two types of rice can be distinguished based on `Area` and `Eccentricity`. Briefly explain.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWith this type of classification problem, it is common to test the performance of a logistic regression model by splitting the data into a *training* and a *test* set. This means that we will choose a random subset of the data to estimate the regression coefficient (training), and we will then test the predictions on the remaining observations (test).\n\n-   Randomly select 75% of the rows of the data to create the training set `rice_train` . Use `set.seed(221)`.\n\n-   Put the remaining 25% of the observations in the testing set called `rice_test`.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nIn a logistic regression model, the *log-odds* of the response being \"1\" (or a \"success\") is given by $$\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\Big) = \\mathbf{x}_i^\\mathsf{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$$\n\nIn this analysis a \"success\" is the Class \"Osmancik\".\n\n-   What does each $\\pi_i$ represent in the context of this analysis?\n\n-   How is the probability of the response variable being \"1\" calculated from the log-odds? Show the mathematical steps to go from the log-odds to the probability in your response.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nUse `rice_train` to fit the logistic regression model for the response variable `Class` on the predictors `Area` and `Eccentricity` .\n\n-   Neatly display the output using 3 digits.\n-   Does the intercept have any reasonable interpretation? If so, interpret the intercept. Otherwise explain why not.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n-   Interpret the coefficients on `Area` and `Eccentricity` in the context of the data in terms of the odds and comment on whether they are useful predictors of `Class` in the model.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\n-   How would you expect the log-odds of the rice grain being of the Osmancik variety to change if the measures eccentricity changes from 0.85 to 0.9?\n\n-   How would you expect the odds of the rice grain being of the Osmancik variety to change if the measures eccentricity changes from 0.85 to 0.9?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nNow let's test our model on the test set. Use the `predict()` function to obtain the predicted probabilities of the rice being Osmancik for the observations in `rice_test.`\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nWith these estimated probabilities, we can now try to classify the rice in the test set. Choose a threshold for assigning a class to each observation based on the estimated probability. Briefly explain your reasoning for selecting the threshold, including any analysis used to make your decision.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nCompare the estimated class assignments you constructed with the actual classes. Comment on the result and thus the model performance.\n\n# Submission\n\nYou will submit the PDF documents for labs, homework, and exams in to Gradescope as part of your final submission.\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.
