Presentation order will be announced in advance. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- Your team will do an in-person presentation that summarizes and showcases the work you've done on the project thus far. Because the presentations will take place while you're still working on the project, it will also be an opportunity to receive feedback and suggestions as well as provide feedback to other teams. The presentation will focus on introducing the subject matter and research question, showcase key results from the exploratory data analysis, and discuss primary modeling strategies and/or results. The presentation should be supported by slides that serve as a brief visual addition to the presentation. The presentation and slides will be graded for content and clarity. -->\n\n<!-- You can create your slides with any software you like (e.g., Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.). You can also use Quarto to make your slides! While we won't be covering making slides with Quarto in the class, we would be happy to help you with it in office hours. It's no different than writing other documents with Quarto, so the learning curve will not be steep! -->\n\n<!-- The presentation is expected to be between 5 to 8 minutes. It may [**not exceed 8 minutes**]{.underline}, due to the limited time during lab. -->\n\n<!-- **Every team member is expected to speak in the presentation.** Part of the grade will be whether every team member had a meaningful speaking role in the presentation. -->\n\n<!-- ### Slides -->\n\n<!-- The slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide to ensure you have enough time to discuss each slide. s Here is a <u>suggested</u> outline as you think through the slides; you do <u>not</u> have to use this exact format for the 6 slides. -->\n\n<!-- -   Title Slide -->\n\n<!-- -   Slide 1: Introduce the subject, motivation, and research question -->\n\n<!-- -   Slide 2: Introduce the data set -->\n\n<!-- -   Slide 3 - 4: Highlights from the EDA (be sure to include EDA for the response variable!) -->\n\n<!-- -   Slide 5: Initial modeling strategies / results -->\n\n<!-- -   Slide 6: Next steps and any questions you'd like to get feedback on -->\n\n<!-- ### Submission -->\n\n<!-- You can submit the presentation slides in two ways: -->\n\n<!-- -   Put a PDF of the slides or Quarto slides in the `presentation` folder in your team's GitHub repo. -->\n\n<!-- -   Put the URL to your slides in the `README` of the `presentation` folder. If you share the URL, please make sure permissions are set so Prof. Tackett can view the slides. -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- Slides must be submitted by the start of your lab on November 11. We will use a classroom computer for the presentations. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ### Grading -->\n\n<!-- The presentation is worth points. It will be graded based on the following: -->\n\n<!-- -   **Content:** The team told a unified story that clearly introduced the subject matter, research question, and exploration of the data. -->\n\n<!-- -   **Slides:** The presentation slides were organized, included clear and informative visualizations, and were easily readable. -->\n\n<!-- -   **Presentation:** The team's communication style was clear and professional. The team divided the time well and stayed within the 8 minute time limit, with each team member making a meaningful contribution to the presentation. -->\n\n<!-- 80% of the presentation grade will be the average of the teaching team scores and 20% will be the average of the peer scores. -->\n\n<!-- ## Presentation comments {#presentation-comments} -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- Click here to see the teams you're scoring and a link to the feedback form. -->\n\n<!-- This portion of the project is worth 2 points and will be assessed individually. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- You will provide feedback on two teams' presentations. The assigned teams and link to the feedback form will be available in advance of the presentations. Please provide all scores and comments by the end of the lab session. There will be a few minutes between each presentation to submit scores and comments. -->\n\n<!-- The grade will be based on submitting the scores and comments for both of your assigned teams by the end of the presentation day, November 11. -->\n\n<!-- ## Analysis + peer review {#draft-report-peer-review} -->\n\n<!-- The purpose of the draft and peer review is to give you an opportunity to get early feedback on your analysis. Therefore, the draft and peer review will focus primarily on the exploratory data analysis, modeling, and initial interpretations. -->\n\n<!-- ### Draft report -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- The draft report is due in your GitHub repo by December 2 at 10am. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- Write the draft in the `written-report.qmd` file in your project repo. -->\n\n<!-- Below is a brief description of the sections to focus on in the draft: -->\n\n<!-- #### Introduction and data -->\n\n<!-- This section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question.

Each lab team will be assigned two other teams' projects to review. Each team should push their draft to their GitHub repo by 10 am on the day their lab's draft is due. The lab that week will be dedicated to the peer review, so your team will have time to review and provide quality feedback to two other teams. -->\n\n<!-- During the peer review process, you will be provided read-only access to your partner teams' GitHub repos. Provide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team's GitHub repo using the issue template provided in the repo. -->\n\n<!-- #### Steps for peer review -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- ## Peer review assignments -->\n\n<!-- [Click here](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/mt324_duke_edu/EbrBSVVPbNZApOqfoakROssB4-K9I92L9wYWDClTH6Q5MA?e=iNelwG) to see the teams you're peer reviewing.You'll spend about 30 minutes reviewing each project. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- -   When you get to lab, you should have access to the GitHub repos for the teams you're reviewing. In GitHub, search the repositories for `project`, and you should see the repos for the projects you're reviewing. You will be able to read the files in the repo and post issues, but you cannot push changes to the repo. You will have access to the repo until the deadline for the peer review. -->\n\n<!-- -   You may choose to all work on both peer reviews or have some team members focus on a single peer review. Either way there will be one peer review grade assigned per team. -->\n\n<!-- -   For each team you're reviewing: -->\n\n<!--     -   Open that team's repo, read the project draft, and browse the rest of the repo. -->\n\n<!--     -   Go to the **Issues** tab in that repo, click on **New issue**, and click on **Get started** for the Peer Review issue. Write your responses to the prompts in the issue. You will answer the the following questions: -->\n\n<!--         -   Describe the goal of the project. -->\n\n<!--         -   Describe the data set used in the project. What are the observations in the data? What is the source of the data? How were the data originally collected? -->\n\n<!--         -   Consider the exploratory data analysis (EDA). Describe one aspect of the EDA that is effective in helping you understand the data. Provide constructive feedback on how the team might improve the EDA. -->\n\n<!--         -   Describe the statistical methods, analysis approach, and discussion of model assumptions, diagnostics, model fit. -->\n\n<!--         -   Provide constructive feedback on how the team might improve their analysis. Make sure your feedback includes at least one comment on the statistical modeling aspect of the project, but also feel free to comment on aspects beyond the modeling. -->\n\n<!--         -   Provide constructive feedback on the interpretations and initial conclusion. What is most effective in the presentation of the results? What additional detail can the team provide to make the results and conclusions easier for the reader to understand? -->\n\n<!--         -   What aspect of this project are you most interested in and think would be interesting to highlight in the written report? -->\n\n<!--         -   Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization. -->\n\n<!--         -   (Optional) Any further comments or feedback? -->\n\n<!-- #### Grading -->\n\n<!-- The peer review will be graded on the extent to which each comprehensively and constructively addresses the components on the peer review form. There will be one peer review grade per team. -->\n\n<!-- ## Round 1 submission (optional) {#round1-submission} -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- The Round 1 submission is due on Sunday, December 8 at 11:59pm. Reports submitted after this date will not receive preliminary feedback. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- The Round 1 submission is an opportunity to receive detailed feedback on your analysis and [Written report](#written-report) before the final submission. Therefore, to make the feedback most useful, **you must submit a complete written report to receive feedback.** You will also be notified of the grade you would receive at that point. You will have the option to keep the grade (and thus you don't need to turn in an updated report) or resubmit the written report by the final submission deadline to receive a new grade. -->\n\n<!-- #### To submit the Round 1 submission: -->\n\n<!-- 1.  Push the updated `written-report.qmd` and `written-report.pdf` to your GitHub repo. -->\n\n<!-- 2.  Open an issue with the title \"Round 1 Submission\". You can use the template issue in the GitHub repo. Make sure I am tagged in the issue (`@matackett`), so I receive an email notification of your Round 1 submission. See [Creating an issue from a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository) for instructions on opening an issue. Please ask a member of the teaching team for assistance if you need help opening the issue. -->\n\n<!-- Note that this is optional, so there is <u>no</u> grade penalty for not turning in a Round 1 submission. Due to time constraints at the end of the semester, only high-level feedback will be given for the reports submitted at the final written report deadline on December 12. -->\n\n<!-- ## Written report {#written-report} -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- The written report is due on Thursday, December 12 at **9pm**.\\ -->\n<!-- \\ -->\n<!-- Your written report must be completed in the `written-report.qmd` file and must be reproducible.

The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. **The report, including tables and visualizations, must be no more than 10 pages long.** There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report. -->\n\n<!-- -   Be selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis. -->\n\n<!-- -   You are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will overwhelmingly be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit. -->\n\n<!-- ### Introduction and data -->\n\n<!-- This section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won't fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships. -->\n\n<!-- <!-- #### Grading criteria --> -->\n\n<!-- <!-- The research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics. --> -->\n\n<!-- ### Methodology -->\n\n<!-- This section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process. -->\n\n<!-- <!-- #### Grading criteria --> -->\n\n<!-- <!-- The analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the variables in the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content. --> -->\n\n<!-- ### Results -->\n\n<!-- <!-- This is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics, conditions, and diagnostics. --> -->\n\n<!-- Describe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader. -->\n\n<!-- <!-- #### Grading criteria --> -->\n\n<!-- <!-- The model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model's predictive power is thoroughly assessed. --> -->\n\n<!-- ### Discussion + Conclusion -->\n\n<!-- In this section you'll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work. -->\n\n<!-- <!-- #### Grading criteria --> -->\n\n<!-- <!-- Overall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described. --> -->\n\n<!-- ### Organization + formatting -->\n\n<!-- This is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report. -->\n\n<!-- <!-- #### Grading criteria --> -->\n\n<!-- <!-- The report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted and labeled. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages. --> -->\n\n<!-- ## Reproducibility + organization {#reproducibility-organization} -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-important -->\n<!-- The repo should be neatly organized by **Thursday, December 12 at 9pm.** -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- All written work (with exception of presentation slides) should be reproducible, and the GitHub repo should be neatly organized. -->\n\n<!-- The GitHub repo should have the following structure: -->\n\n<!-- -   `README`: Short project description and data dictionary -->\n\n<!-- -   `written-report.qmd` & `written-report.pdf`: Final written report -->\n\n<!-- -   `proposal.qmd` & `proposal.pdf`: Project proposal -->\n\n<!-- -   `research-questions.qmd` & `research-questions.pdf`: Proposed research questions -->\n\n<!-- -   `/data`: Folder that contains the data set for the final project. -->\n\n<!-- -   `project.Rproj`: File specifying the RStudio project -->\n\n<!-- -   `/presentation`: Folder with the presentation slides or link to slides. -->\n\n<!-- -   `.gitignore`: File that lists all files that are in the local RStudio project but not the GitHub repo -->\n\n<!-- -   `/.github`: Folder for peer review issue template -->\n\n<!-- -   Any other files should be neatly organized into clearly labeled folders. -->\n\n<!-- Update the README of the project repo with your project title and a few sentences (\\~ 2 -5) describing your final project. -->\n\n<!-- Points for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written report and the organization of the project GitHub repo. The repo should be neatly organized as described above, there should be no extraneous files, all text in the `README` should be easily readable. -->\n\n<!-- ## Peer teamwork evaluation -->\n\n<!-- There will be an opportunity to provide feedback to Professor Tackett about each team member's contribution to the project. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly. -->\n\n<!-- ## Overall grading -->\n\n<!-- The grade breakdown is as follows: -->\n\n<!-- | Total                          | 100 pts | -->\n<!-- |--------------------------------|---------| -->\n<!-- | Research question              | 3 pts   | -->\n<!-- | Project proposal               | 10 pts  | -->\n<!-- | Exploratory data analysis      | 15 pts  | -->\n<!-- | Presentation                   | 10 pts  | -->\n<!-- | Presentation comments          | 2 pts   | -->\n<!-- | Draft report + peer review     | 15 pts  | -->\n<!-- | Written report                 | 40 pts  | -->\n<!-- | Reproducibility + organization | 5 pts   | -->\n\n<!-- ### Grading summary -->\n\n<!-- Grading of the project will take into account the following: -->\n\n<!-- -   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions? -->\n\n<!-- -   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly? -->\n\n<!-- -   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations? -->\n\n<!-- -   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project? -->\n\n<!-- A general breakdown of scoring is as follows: -->\n\n<!-- -   *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others. -->\n\n<!-- -   *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others. -->\n\n<!-- -   *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear. -->\n\n<!-- -   *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear. -->\n\n<!-- -   *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort. -->\n\n<!-- ## Late work policy -->\n\n<!-- There is no late work accepted on the draft report or presentation. Other components of the project may be accepted up to 48 hours late. A 10% late deduction will apply for each 24-hour period late. -->\n\n<!-- **Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.** -->\n",
