# Data

The data set comes from @zarulli2021 who analyze the effects of a country's healthcare expenditure and other factors on the country's life expectancy. The data are originally from the [Human Development Database](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) and [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).

-   `life_exp`: The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic income_inequality. ( from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/65#:~:text=Definition%3A,%2C%20territory%2C%20or%20geographic%20area.))

-   `income_inequality`: Measure of the deviation of the distribution of income among individuals or households within a country from a perfectly equal distribution. A value of 0 represents absolute equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality (Gini coefficient). (from @zarulli2021)

-   `health_expend`: Per capita current spending on on healthcare good sand services, expressed in respective currency - international Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollar ([from the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/4952))

-   `health_pct_gdp`: Spending on healthcare goods and services, expressed as a percentage of GDP. It excludes capital health expenditures such as buildings, machinery, information technology and stocks of vaccines for emergency or outbreaks (from @zarulli2021).

```

# Part 1

## Exercise 1

Fit a model using income equality to understand variability in life expectancy. Neatly display the results using 3 digits.

```{r}
#| label: ex-1

# add code here

```

## Exercise 2

-   Interpret the slope in the context of the data.

-   Does it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, interpret it in the context of the data. Otherwise, explain why not.

# Part 2

We now want to understand the relationship between a country's healthcare expenditure and its life expectancy. The data set contains two measures for healthcare expenditure: `health_expend` and `health_pct_gdp`.

## Exercise 3

Fit a model using `health_expend` to understand variability in `life_exp`. Compute $R^2$ and $RMSE$ for this model.

```{r}
#| label: ex-3

# add code here

```

-   Interpret $R^2$ in the context of the data.

-   Interpret $RMSE$ in the context for the data.

## Exercise 4

Which measure of healthcare expenditure would you choose as a predictor of life expectancy - `health_expend` or `health_pct_gdp`? Briefly explain, using $R^2$ and/or $RMSE$ to support your choice.

```{r}
