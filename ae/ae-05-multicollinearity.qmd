# Introduction

The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data at the beginning a trail in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to November 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station. The data were collected from by [Pioneer Valley Planning Commission](http://www.fvgreenway.org/pdfs/Northampton-Bikepath-Volume-Counts%20_05_LTA.pdf) via the **mosaicData** package.

We will use the following variables in this analysis:

**Outcome**:

-   `volume` estimated number of trail users that day (number of breaks recorded)

**Predictors**

-   `hightemp` daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `avgtemp` average of daily low and daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `season` one of “Fall”, “Spring”, or “Summer”

-   `precip` measure of precipitation (in inches)

rail_trail <- read_csv("data/rail_trail.csv")
```

# Part 1

## Exercise 1

-   Fit the regression model using high temperature, average temperature, season, and precipitation to predict volume.

-   Are there any coefficients that may be not what you expected?

```{r}
#| label: ex-1

# add code here

```

## Exercise 2

-   Use the formula

$$
VIF_j = \frac{1}{1 - R^2_j} 
$$

to calculate the VIF for `avgtemp`.

```{r}
#| label: ex-2

# add code here

```

## Exercise 3

Based on the VIF from the previous exercise, does `avgtemp` have a linear dependency with one or more other predictors? Explain.

## Exercise 4

-   Fill in the name of the model from Exercise 1 to calculate VIF for all predictors. (Remove `#| eval: false` after you've filled in the code.)

-   Are there predictors with linear dependencies? If so, which ones?

```{r}
#| label: ex-4
#| eval: false

vif(____)

```

# Part 2

## Exercise 5

Let's try to deal with the mulitcollinearity by removing one of the predictors that are linearly dependent. Choose a final model using this strategy.

```{r}
#| label: ex-5

# add code here

```
