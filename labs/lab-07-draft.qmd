# Due date

This lab is due on **Tuesday, April 4 at 11:59pm.** To be considered on time, the following must be done by the due date:

-   Final `.qmd` and `.pdf` files pushed to your team's GitHub repo
-   Final `.pdf` file submitted on Gradescope
:::

# Logistic Regression

In this lab, you will use logistic regression analysis to classify rice varieties based on features derived from image data. You will fit and interpret the logistic regression models using training data, then use testing data to assess how well the model classifies observations into the two varieties.

# Learning goals

By the end of the lab you will be able to…

-   conduct exploratory data analysis for data with a binary response variable.

-   fit and interpret logistic regression model.

-   use relevant metrics and subject-matter context to identify a threshold for classification.

-   use training and testing data to fit and assess model performance.

# Getting started

-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.

-   Go to the [sta221-sp25](https://github.com/sta221-sp25) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-07**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.

# Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team

::: callout-important
There are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in [Lab 03](../lab-03.html). Only one person should type in the group’s .qmd file at a time to avoid merge conflicts. Once that person has finished typing the group’s responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.

Every teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.

# Data

The data in this lab contains measures describing the shape and structure of two rice varieties - *Cammeo* and *Osmancik*. To curate the data set, researchers used images from over 3,000 grains a rice in these two varieties. They then used automated methods to process the image data and extract 7 morphological features (features related to the structure) from each image. The data were originally presented and analyzed in @cinar2019classification and was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik).

This analysis will focus on the following variables:

-   `Class`: Cammeo or Osmancik

-   `Area`: Size of the rice grain measured in pixels

-   `Eccentricity`: A measure of how round the ellipse is, i.e., how close the shape of the grain is to a circle.

[Click here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik) for the full data dictionary.

```{r}
#| lable: read-data
rice <- read_csv("data/rice.csv")
```

# Exercises

**Goal**: The goal of the analysis is to use Area and Eccentricity to identify grains from the Cammeo variety versus those from the Osmancik variety.

## Exercise 1

We'll begin by exploring the data. Create a scatterplot of `Area` versus `Eccentricity` with the color and shape of the points by `Class`.

## Exercise 2

Based on the plot from the previous exercise, do you think the two types of rice can be distinguished based on `Area` and `Eccentricity`. Briefly explain.

## Exercise 3

With this type of classification problem, it is common to test the performance of a logistic regression model by splitting the data into a *training* and a *test* set. (Recall training and test sets from [Lab 02](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/labs/lab-02.html#exercise-1)). This means that we will choose a random subset of the data to estimate the regression coefficient, and we will then test the predictions on the remaining observations.

-   Randomly select 75% of the rows of the data to create the training set `rice_train` . Use `set.seed(221)`.

-   Put the remaining 25% of the observations in the test set called `rice_test`.

## Exercise 4

In a logistic regression model, the *log-odds* of the response being "1" (or a "success") is given by $$\log\Big(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\Big) = \mathbf{x}_i^\mathsf{T} \boldsymbol{\beta}$$

In this analysis a "success" is the Class "Osmancik".

-   What does each $\pi_i$ represent in the context of this analysis?

-   How is the probability of the response variable being "1" calculated from the log-odds? Show the mathematical steps to go from the log-odds to the probability in your response.

## Exercise 5

Use `rice_train` to fit the logistic regression model for the response variable `Class` on the predictors `Area` and `Eccentricity` .

-   Neatly display the output using 3 digits.
-   Does the intercept have any reasonable interpretation? If so, interpret the intercept. Otherwise explain why not.

## Exercise 6

-   Interpret the coefficients on `Area` and `Eccentricity` in the context of the data in terms of the odds and comment on whether they are useful predictors of `Class` in the model.

## Exercise 7

-   How would you expect the log-odds of the rice grain being of the Osmancik variety to change if the measures eccentricity changes from 0.85 to 0.9?

-   How would you expect the odds of the rice grain being of the Osmancik variety to change if the measures eccentricity changes from 0.85 to 0.9?

## Exercise 8

Now let's test our model on the test set. Use the `predict()` function to obtain the predicted probabilities of the rice being Osmancik for the observations in `rice_test.`

## Exercise 9

With these estimated probabilities, we can now try to classify the rice in the test set. Choose a threshold for assigning a class to each observation based on the estimated probability. Briefly explain your reasoning for selecting the threshold, including any analysis used to make your decision.

## Exercise 10

Compare the estimated class assignments you constructed with the actual classes. Comment on the result and thus the model performance.

# Submission
