# Getting Started

-   Go to the [sta221-sp25](https://www.github.com/sta221-sp25) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-04**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [Lab 00 instructions](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/labs/lab-00#getting-started) for details on cloning a repo and starting a new project in R.

# Packages

You will need the following packages for the lab:

```{r}
#| label: packages

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels) 
library(knitr)
library(patchwork)

# add other packages as needed
```

# Restaurant tips

**What factors are associated with the amount customers tip at a restaurant?** To answer this question, we will use data collected in 2011 by a student at St. Olaf who worked at a local restaurant.[^1]

[^1]: Dahlquist, Samantha, and Jin Dong. 2011. "The Effects of Credit Cards on Tipping." Project for Statistics 212-Statistics for the Sciences, St. Olaf College.

The variables we'll focus on for this analysis are

-   `Tip`: amount of the tip
-   `Party`: number of people in the party
-   `Age`: Age of the payer

View the data set to see the remaining variables.

```{r}
#| message: false

tips <- read_csv("data/tip-data.csv")
```

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
#| label: univariate-eda
#| warning: false

p1 <- ggplot(data = tips, aes(x = Tip)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 2) +
  labs(x = "Tips ($)",
       title = "Tips at local restaurant")

p2 <- ggplot(data = tips, aes(x = Party)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Party",
       title = "Number of diners in party") +
  xlim(c(0, 7))

p3 <- ggplot(data = tips, aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_bar(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "",
       title = "Age of Payer") 

p1 / (p2 + p3)
```

```{r}
#| label: bivariate-eda

p4 <- ggplot(data = tips, aes(x = Party, y = Tip)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  labs(x = "Number of diners in party", 
       y = "Tips ($)",
       title = "Tips vs. Party")

p5 <- ggplot(data = tips, aes(x = Age, y = Tip)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Age of payer", 
       y = "Tips ($)",
       title = "Tips vs. Age")

p4 + p5
```

**We will use the number of diners in the party and age of the payer to understand variability in the tips.**

## Exercise 1

We will start with the main effects model that includes `Age` and `Party`.

a.  How many indicator variables for `Age` can we create from the data?
b.  How many indicator variables for `Age` will be in the regression model?
c.  Are the responses to parts a and b equal? If not, explain why not.
d.  Which of the following is true for this model? Select all that apply.
    i.  The intercepts are the same for every level of `Age`.
    ii. The intercepts differ by `Age`.
    iii. The effect of `Party` is the same for every level of `Age`.
    iv. The effect of `Party` differs by `Age`.

## Exercise 2

Consider the main effects model that includes `Age` and `Party`.

a.  What is the dimension of the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ for the main effects model?

b.  Calculate the coefficient estimates $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ directly from the data.

c.  Write the equation of the estimated regression model.

```{r}
#| label: ex-2

# add code here 

```

## Exercise 3

Consider the main effects model that includes `Age` and `Party`. Get $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ from the data.

a.  Use $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ to compute $\hat{\sigma}_{\epsilon}$ .
b.  Interpret $\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon$ in the context of the data.
c.  Compute $Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})$.
d.  You wish to test whether there is a linear relationship between tips and the number of diners in the party, after adjusting for the age of the payer. Compute the test statistic.

```{r}
#| label: ex-3

# add code here

```

## Exercise 4

Consider the main effects model that includes `Age` and `Party`. Get $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ from the data.

a.  Use $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ to compute $R^2$. Interpret this value in the context of the data.
b.  Use $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ to compute $RMSE$. Interpret this value in the context of the data.

```{r}
#| label: ex-4

# add code here

```

## Exercise 5

You decide to add an interaction effect between `Age` and `Party` to the model and fit a model of the following form:

$$
Tip_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Party_i + \beta_2SenCit_i + \beta_3Yadult_i + \beta_4Party_i \times SenCit_i + \beta_5 Party_i \times Yadult_i + \epsilon_i
$$

a.  Which of the following is true for this model? Select all that apply.
    i.  The intercepts are the same for every level of `Age`.
    ii. The intercepts differ by `Age`.
    iii. The effect of `Party` is the same for every level of `Age`.
    iv. The effect of `Party` differs by `Age`.
b.  By how much does the intercept for tables with young adult payers differ from tables with middle age payers? Write the answer in terms of the $\beta$'s.
c.  Write the equation of the model for tables in which the payer is a senior citizen.
d.  Suppose you wish to test the hypotheses: $H_0: \beta_5 = 0 \text{ vs. }H_a: \beta_5 \neq 0$ . State what is being tested in terms of the effect of `Party`.

## Exercise 6

Consider the model that includes `Age` and `Party` and the interaction between the two variables. Get $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ from the data.

a.  Use $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ to compute the standard error of `AgeSenCit`. State what this value means in the context of the data.
b.  Compute $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ to compute the 90% confidence interval for `AgeSenCit`.
c.  Interpret the interval in the context of the data.
d.  Based on the confidence interval, is there evidence the coefficient of `AgeSenCit` is different from 0?

## Exercise 7

The following are general questions about regression. They are not specific to the tips data set.

a.  What does it mean for an estimator to be the "least-squares" estimator?

b.  Consider the derivation of the least-squares estimator:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
     \nabla_{\beta}\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^\mathsf{T}\boldsymbol{\epsilon} &= \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}[(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})^\mathsf{T}(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})] \\[5pt]
    &=\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}[\mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} - \boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} + \boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}] \\[5pt]
    &=\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}[\mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - 2\boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} + \boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}]\\[5pt]
     & = -2\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} + 2\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \\[5pt]
    &\Rightarrow \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Explain how $-\mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} - \boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}$ is simplified to $-2\boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}$ when going from lines 2 to 3.

c.  Explain what rules were used to compute the gradient in line 4.

## Exercise 8

Below we show how SSR = $\mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
SSR = \mathbf{e}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{e} &= (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})^\mathsf{T}(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}) \\[5pt]
& = \mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} + \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \\[5pt]
&= \mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - 2\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}+\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\\[5pt]
& = \mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} 
\end{aligned}
$$

a\. Explain how $-\mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} - \boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}$ is simplified to $-2\boldsymbol{\beta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}$ when going from lines 2 to

b\. Explain how we know $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} = \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ when going from lines 3 to 4.
