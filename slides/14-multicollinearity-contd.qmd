-   Multicollinearity

    -   Recap

    -   How to deal with issues of multicollinearity

## Data: Trail users {.midi}

-   The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data at the beginning a trail in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to November 15, 2005.
-   Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

rail_trail <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/rail_trail.csv"))
rail_trail |> slice(1:5)
```

Source: [Pioneer Valley Planning Commission](http://www.fvgreenway.org/pdfs/Northampton-Bikepath-Volume-Counts%20_05_LTA.pdf) via the **mosaicData** package.

## Variables

**Outcome**:

-   `volume` estimated number of trail users that day (number of breaks recorded)

**Predictors**

-   `hightemp` daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `avgtemp` average of daily low and daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `season` one of “Fall”, “Spring”, or “Summer”

-   `precip` measure of precipitation (in inches)

## EDA: Relationship between predictors {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

rail_trail |>
  select(hightemp, avgtemp, season, precip) |>
  ggpairs()
```

## Multicollinearity {.midi}

-   **Multicollinearity**: near-linear dependence among predictors

-   The **variance inflation factor (VIF)** measures how much the linear dependencies impact the variance of the predictors

$$
VIF_{j} = \frac{1}{1 - R^2_j}
$$

where $R^2_j$ is the proportion of variation in $x_j$ that is explained by a linear combination of all the other predictors

-   Thresholds:
    -   VIF \> 10: concerning multicollinearity
    -   VIF \> 5: potentially worth further investigation

## How multicollinearity impacts model {.midi}

-   Large variance for the model coefficients that are collinear

    -   Different combinations of coefficient estimates produce equally good model fits

-   Unreliable statistical inference results

    -   May conclude coefficients are not statistically significant when there is, in fact, a relationship between the predictors and response

-   Interpretation of coefficient is no longer "holding all other variables constant", since this would be impossible for correlated predictors

## Dealing with multicollinearity

::: incremental
-   Collect more data (often not feasible given practical constraints)

-   Redefine the correlated predictors to keep the information from predictors but eliminate collinearity

    -   e.g., if $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are correlated, use a new variable $(x_1 + x_2) / x_3$ in the model

-   For categorical predictors, avoid using levels with very few observations as the baseline

-   Remove one of the correlated variables

    -   Be careful about substantially reducing predictive power of the model
