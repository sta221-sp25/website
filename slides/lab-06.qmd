## Reminder: Tips for working on a team

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.
