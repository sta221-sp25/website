## Topics

-   Multicollinearity

    -   Definition

    -   How it impacts the model

    -   How to detect it

    -   What to do about it

## Data: Trail users {.midi}

-   The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data at the beginning a trail in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to November 15, 2005 to
-   Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

rail_trail <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/rail_trail.csv"))
rail_trail |> slice(1:5)
```

Source: [Pioneer Valley Planning Commission](http://www.fvgreenway.org/pdfs/Northampton-Bikepath-Volume-Counts%20_05_LTA.pdf) via the **mosaicData** package.

## Variables

**Outcome**:

-   `volume` estimated number of trail users that day (number of breaks recorded)

**Predictors**

-   `hightemp` daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `avgtemp` average of daily low and daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-   `season` one of “Fall”, “Spring”, or “Summer”

-   `precip` measure of precipitation (in inches)

## EDA: Relationship between predictors

We can create a pairwise plot matrix using the `ggpairs` function from the **GGally** R package

```{r}
#| eval: false

rail_trail |>
  select(hightemp, avgtemp, season, precip) |>
  ggpairs()
```

## EDA: Relationship between predictors {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

rail_trail |>
  select(hightemp, avgtemp, season, precip) |>
  ggpairs()
```

::: question
What might be a potential concern with a model that uses high temperature, average temperature, season, and precipitation to predict volume?

# Multicollinearity

## Multicollinearity

-   Ideally there is no linear relationship (dependence) between the predictors

    -   This is generally not the case in practice but is often not a major issue

-   **Multicollinearity**: there are near-linear dependencies between predictors

## Common sources of multicollinearity

::: incremental
-   Dependencies that generally occur in the population

-   How the model is defined and the variables that are included

-   Sample comes from only a subspace of the region of predictors

-   There are more predictor variables than observations
:::

## Detecting multicollinearity

-   **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: measure of multicollinearity in the regression model

$$
VIF_j = \frac{1}{1 - R^2_j}
$$

where $R^2_j$ is the proportion of variation in $x_j$ that is explained by a linear combination of all the other predictors

## Detecting multicollinearity

-   Common practice uses threshold $VIF > 10$ as indication of concerning multicollinearity

-   Variables with similar values of VIF are typically the ones correlated with each other

-   Use the `vif()` function in the **rms** R package to calculate VIF

## Effects of multicollinearity

::: incremental
-   Large variance $(\hat{\sigma}^2_{\epsilon}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1})$ in the model coefficients

    -   Different combinations of coefficient estimates produce equally good model fits

-   Unreliable statistical inference results

    -   May conclude coefficients are not statistically significant when there is, in fact, a relationship between the predictors and response

-   Interpretation of coefficient is no longer "holding all other variables constant", since this would be impossible for correlated predictors

## Dealing with multicollinearity

::: incremental
-   Collect more data (often not feasible given practical constraints)

-   Redefine the correlated predictors to keep the information from predictors but eliminate collinearity

    -   e.g., if $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are correlated, use a new variable $(x_1 + x_2) / x_3$ in the model

-   For categorical predictors, avoid using levels with very few observations as the baseline

-   Remove one of the correlated variables

    -   Be careful about substantially reducing predictive power of the model
