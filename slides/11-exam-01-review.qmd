## Announcements

-   HW 02 due TODAY at 11:59pm

-   Exam 01: Tuesday, February 18 (in-class + take-home)

    -   Go directly to assigned room (emailed Wednesday evening)

-   Friday's lab: Exam 01 review - Graded on attendance and participation

-   No office hours February 18 - 20

## Exam 01

-   50 points total

    -   in-class: 35 points

    -   take-home: 15 points

-   In-class: 75 minutes during February 18 lecture

-   Take-home: due February 20 at 9pm (no lecture on Thursday)

-   If you miss any part of the exam for an excused absence (with academic dean‚Äôs note), your Exam 02 score will be counted twice

## Outline of in-class portion {.midi}

-   Closed-book, closed-note.

-   Question types:

    -   Short answer (show work / explain response)
    -   True/ False.
        -   If false, write 1 - 2 sentence justification about why it is false.
    -   Derivations

-   Will be provided all relevant R output and a page of [matrix calculus and probability rules](../math-rules.html)

-   Can use any results from class or assignments without reproving them (e.g., $\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric and idempotent)

-   Just need a pencil or pen. No calculator permitted on exam.

## Outline of take-home portion

-   Released: Tuesday, February 18 right after class
-   Due: Thursday, February 20 at 9pm (no lecture February 20)
-   Similar in format to a lab/ HW
    -   Will receive Exam questions in README of GitHub repo
    -   Formatting + using a reproducible workflow will be part of grade
-   Submit a PDF of responses to GitHub

## Tips for studying {.midi}

-   Rework derivations from assignments and lecture notes
-   Review exercises in AEs and assignments, asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù as you review your process and reasoning
    -   e.g., Why do we include ‚Äúholding all else constant‚Äù in interpretations?
-   Focus on understanding not memorization
-   Explain concepts / process to others
-   Ask questions in office hours
-   Review lecture recordings as needed

## Population-level vs. sample-level models

**Statistical model (population-level model)**

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \quad \epsilon \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2_{\epsilon}\mathbf{I})
$$

<br>

**Estimated regression model (sample-level model)**

$$
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\quad \quad \mathbf{e} = \mathbf{y} - \hat{\mathbf{y}}
$$

## Model in matrix form

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
$$

<br>

::: question
1.  What are the dimensions of $\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ ?
2.  What assumption do we make about the columns of $\mathbf{X}$? Why is that important?
:::

## Model in matrix form

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
$$

<br>

::: question
1.  What assumptions do we make about $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ making given this model?
2.  What does this model tell us about the distribution of $\mathbf{y}$ ?
:::

## Find least-squares estimator $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$

## Expected value of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$

## Variance of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$

## SSR

::: question
Show

$$
SSR = \mathbf{y}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{y}
$$
