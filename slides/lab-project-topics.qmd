# Welcome

## Goals

-   Team icebreaker
-   Hypothesis testing practice
-   Final project - research topics

## Icebreaker

-   Get into your lab teams.
-   Choose a reporter
    -   Need help choosing? Person with birthday closest to todayâ€™s date.
-   Identify **8 things** everyone in the group has in common (\~ 5 minutes)
    -   Not being a Duke student

    -   Not clothes (e.g., weâ€™re all wearing socks)

    -   Not body parts (e.g., we all have a nose)
-   Reporter will share list with the class.

## Hypothesis testing {.midi}

Below is the model using student enrollment (in thousands) and institution type to predict an institution's football expenditures (in millions). [Click here](https://sta221-sp25.netlify.app/slides/09-inference-pt2#/data-ncaa-football-expenditures) for more details about the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(knitr)

football <- read_csv("data/ncaa-football-exp.csv")

exp_fit <- lm(total_exp_m ~ enrollment_th + type, data = football)
tidy(exp_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

\

::: question
-   Explain what each value in the row for `typePublic` means.

-   Do the data provide evidence that institution type is a useful predictor in this model?
:::

## Final team project {.midi}

-   **Goal**: Use the methods from STA 221 to analyze data and answer a research question developed by your team

-   **Primary deliverables:**

    1.  an in-person presentation about the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling

    2.  a written, reproducible final report detailing your analysis

    3.  a summary of your project highlights to share with the class

    4.  a GitHub repository containing all work from the project

-   There are periodic project milestones throughout the semester to help you work towards the primary deliverables

## Today's focus: Research topics

-   **Goals:** Identify three potential research topics your team is interested in investigating and draft research questions.

-   You do [**not**]{.underline} need to have a data set at this point

-   You can discuss the topics you put in the student survey to help generate ideas

-   **Submission**: All work for the project will be submitted in your teamâ€™s GitHub repo. You will receive feedback via an Issue on GitHub to model a workflow often used in practice.
