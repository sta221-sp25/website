# Welcome

## Goals

-   LaTex in this course
-   Lab 02: Linear regression

## LaTex in this class

For this class you will need to be able to...

-   Properly write mathematical symbols, e.g., $\beta_1$ not *B1,* $R^2$ not *R2*

-   Write basic regression equations, e.g., $\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$

-   Write matrix equations: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$

-   Write hypotheses (we'll start this next week), e.g., $H_0: \beta = 0$

You are welcome to but <u>not</u> required to write math proofs using LaTex.

## Writing LaTex (from [AE 02](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/ae/ae-02-mlr)) {.midi}

**Inline:** Your mathematics will display within the line of text.

-   Use `$` to start and end your LaTex syntax. You can also use the menu: *Insert -\> LaTex Math -\> Inline Math*.

-   *Example*: The text `The simple linear regression model is $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$` produces

    The simple linear regression model is $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$

## Writing LaTex (from [AE 02](https://sta221-fa24.netlify.app/ae/ae-02-mlr)) {.midi}

**Display:** Your mathematics will display outside the line of text

-   Use a `$$` to start and end your LaTex syntax. You can also use the menu: *Insert -\> LaTex Math -\> Display Math*.

-   *Example*: The text `The estimated regression equation is $$\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$$` produces

    The estimated regression equation is

$$
\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}
$$

# Teams

## Meet your team!

-   [**Click here**](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/mt324_duke_edu/Ea9WHPhr91VAphXfELUbLBsB50LvI-KohMqfQcnpR_6guA?e=JgEpVq) to find your team.

-   Sit with your team.

## Team name + agreement

-   Come up with a team name. You can't have the same name as another group in the class, so be creative!

    -   Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.

-   Fill out the team agreement. The goals of the agreement are to...

    -   Gain a common understanding of the team's goals and expectations for collaboration
    -   Make a plan for team communication
    -   Make a plan for working outside of lab

## Team workflow

-   Only <u>**one**</u> team member should type at a time. There are markers in today's lab to help you determine whose turn it is to type.

    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.

-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.

    ::: callout-important
    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Read the submission instructions carefully!**
    :::

## Team workflow, in action

-   Complete the "Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team" section of the lab in your teams.
-   Raise your hand if you have any questions about the workflow.

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, font_size = "2em")
```

## Tips for working on a team {.midi}

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.

## Lab 02: Childcare costs

Todayâ€™s lab focuses on using multiple linear regression (Week 03 content) to predict childcare costs for school-aged children in North Carolina.
