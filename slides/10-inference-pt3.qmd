## Data: NCAA Football expenditures {.midi}

Today's data come from [Equity in Athletics Data Analysis](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list) and includes information about sports expenditures and revenues for colleges and universities in the United States. This data set was featured in a [March 2022 Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-03-29/readme.md).

We will focus on the 2019 - 2020 season expenditures on football for institutions in the NCAA - Division 1 FBS. The variables are :

-   `total_exp_m`: Total expenditures on football in the 2019 - 2020 academic year (in millions USD)

-   `enrollment_th`: Total student enrollment in the 2019 - 2020 academic year (in thousands)

-   `type`: institution type (Public or Private)

```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: false

## code to make data set for these notes

sports <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-03-29/sports.csv') 

# filter data to only include D1 football for the year 2019

sports |>
  filter(sports == "Football", 
         classification_name == "NCAA Division I-FBS", year == 2019) |>
  mutate(type = if_else(sector_name == "Private nonprofit, 4-year or above", "Private", "Public"), 
         enrollment_th = ef_total_count / 1000,
         total_exp_m = total_exp_menwomen/ 1000000) |>
  select(year, institution_name, city_txt, state_cd, zip_text, type,
         enrollment_th, 
         total_exp_m) |> 
  write_csv("data/ncaa-football-exp.csv")


```

```{r}
football <- read_csv("data/ncaa-football-exp.csv")
```

## Regression model

# Inference for a single coefficient

## Inference for $\beta_j$

We often want to conduct inference on individual model coefficients

-   **Hypothesis test:** Is there a linear relationship between the response and $x_j$?

-   **Confidence interval**: What is a plausible range of values $\beta_j$ can take?

## Sampling distribution of $\hat{\beta}$ {.midi}

-   A **sampling distribution** is the probability distribution of a statistic for a large number of random samples of size $n$ from a population

-   The sampling distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is the probability distribution of the estimated coefficients if we repeatedly took samples of size $n$ and fit the regression model

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sim N(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2_\epsilon(\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1})
$$

The estimated coefficients $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ are **normally distributed** with

$$
E(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) = \boldsymbol{\beta} \hspace{10mm} Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) = \sigma^2_{\epsilon}(\boldsymbol{X}^\mathsf{T}\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}
$$

## Sampling distribution of $\hat{\beta}_j$


$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sim N(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2_\epsilon(\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1})
$$

Let $\mathbf{C} = (\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{X})^{-1}$. Then, for each coefficient $\hat{\beta}_j$,

::: incremental
-   $E(\hat{\beta}_j) = \boldsymbol{\beta}_j$, the $j^{th}$ element of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$

-   $Var(\hat{\beta}_j) = \sigma^2_{\epsilon}C_{jj}$

-   $Cov(\hat{\beta}_i, \hat{\beta}_j) = \sigma^2_{\epsilon}C_{ij}$
:::

# Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$

## Steps for a hypothesis test

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2.  Calculate a test statistic.
3.  Calculate the p-value.
4.  State the conclusion.

<br>

::: question
Let's walk through the steps to test $\beta_j$, the coefficient for `typePublic` .
:::

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$: Hypotheses

We will generally test the hypotheses:

-   **Null:** There is no linear relationship between institution type and football expenditure, after adjusting for enrollment $H_0: \beta_j = 0$

-   **Alternative:** There is a linear relationship between institution type and football expenditure, after adjusting for enrollment $H_a: \beta_j \neq 0$

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$: Test statistic {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false

tidy(exp_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

**Test statistic:** Number of standard errors the estimate is away from the null

$$
\text{Test Statistic} = \frac{\text{Estimate - Null}}{\text{Standard error}} = \frac{-13.226 - 0}{3.153} = -4.195 \\
$$

. . .

This means the estimated slope of -13.226 is 4.195 standard errors below the hypothesized mean of 0.

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$: p-value {.midi}

-   The test statistic follows a $t$ distribution with `r nrow(football) - 3 - 1` degrees of freedom.

$$
p-value = P(|T| > |-13.226|)
$$

. . .

```{r}
2 * pt(13.226, df = nrow(football) - 3 - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
<br>
. . .

Given $\beta_j = 0$ ( $H_0$ is true), the probability of observing a slope of -13.226 or more extreme is $\approx 0$ . 

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_j$: Conclusion

-   The p-value is $\approx 0$, so we **reject** $H_0$.

-   The data provide sufficient evidence that $\beta_j \neq 0$, meaning evidence there is a linear relationship between institution type and football expenditure, after adjusting for enrollment.

# Confidence interval for $\beta_j$

## Confidence interval for $\beta_j$ {.midi}

::: incremental
-   A plausible range of values for a population parameter is called a **confidence interval**

-   Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net

    -   We can throw a spear where we saw a fish but we will probably miss, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish

    -   Similarly, if we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter, but if we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter
:::

## What "confidence" means {.midi}

::: incremental
-   We will construct $C\%$ confidence intervals.

    -   The confidence level impacts the width of the interval

-   "Confident" means if we were to take repeated samples of the same size as our data, fit regression lines using the same predictors, and calculate $C\%$ Cs for the coefficient of $x_j$, then $C\%$ of those intervals will contain the true value of the coefficient $\beta_j$

-   Balance precision and accuracy when selecting a confidence level
:::

## Confidence interval for $\beta_j$

$$
\text{Estimate} \pm \text{ (critical value) } \times \text{SE}
$$

<br>

. . .

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* \times SE({\hat{\beta}_j})
$$

where $t^*$ is calculated from a $t$ distribution with $n-p-1$ degrees of freedom

## Confidence interval: Critical value

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
```{r}
#| echo: true

# confidence level: 95%
qt(0.975, df = nrow(football) - 2 - 1)
```
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
```{r}
# confidence level: 90%
qt(0.95, df = nrow(football) - 2 - 1)
```
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
```{r}
# confidence level: 99%
qt(0.995, df = nrow(football) - 2 - 1)
```
:::

## 95% CI for $\beta_j$: Calculation

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(exp_fit) |> 
  kable(digits = 3)
```

## 95% CI for $\beta_j$ in R

```{r}
#| echo: true

tidy(exp_fit, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95) |> 
  kable(digits = 3)
```

<br>

**Interpretation**: We are 95% confident that for each additional 1,000 students enrolled, the institution's expenditures on football will be greater by \$562,000 to \$999,000, on average, holding institution type constant.
